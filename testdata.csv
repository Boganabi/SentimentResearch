3.0,Smells like gasoline! Going back!,"First & most offensive: they reek of gasoline so if you are sensitive/allergic to petroleum products like I am you will want to pass on these.  Second: the phone adapter is useless as-is. Mine was not drilled far enough to be able to tighten it into place for my iPhone 12 max. It just slipped & slid all over. Stupid me putting the adapter together first without picking up the binoculars to smell them bc I wasted 15 minutes trying to figure out how to put the adapter together bc it does not come with instructions!  I had to come back here to the website which was a total pain. Third: the tripod is also useless. I would not trust the iOS to hold my $1600 phone nor even a Mattel Barbie for that matter. It’s just inefficient for the job imo.  Third: in order to try to give an honest review I did don gloves & eyewear to check the binoculars out.  They seemed average except for mine seemed to be missing about 10% of the film costing in the lower edge of one of the lenses which would have ruined every video & photograph unplanned to take so for me these are a very huge hard pass.  I expect the accessories that come with the main product to be as good or better than the product I’m buying. Otherwise I would just buy the product as a stand alone.  Sadly, I found a decent pair of binoculars last year with a much better quality phone adapter & tripod, but they had a defect too.  Guess I’m going to have to pay more.  Ugh.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YN+Qk3kCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YN+Qk3kCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YN+Qk3kCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B083NRGZMM,B083NRGZMM,AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ,1658185117948,True,0

5.0,Excellent!,"I love these. They even come with a carry case and several sizes of ear bud inserts. Thank heaven!  I get ear pain from most, but the smallest buds fit great.  They also have a charger and all of it fits in the carry case. I just wish they came in more colors preferably something bright!

5.0,Great laptop backpack!,"I was searching for a sturdy backpack for school that would allow me to carry my laptop as well as schoolbooks. After reading many of the reviews of this bag, I placed my order and crossed my fingers. I shouldn't have worried; it's a great bag! Solidly built and traveler-friendly with a ton of compartments for every little thing one might need to stow away. While this backpack is slightly larger than your average backpack, it is comfortable to wear trekking cross campus. Also, another aspect of this bag that I love is that it stands upright. I know that sounds kinda crazy, but I find it annoying when your backpack flops over next to your desk and stuff kind of just falls out, or if you need to grab something quickly out of the bag you have to awkwardly curl your body around the side of your chair and then on the way up, smash your head against the desk. So yeah, lazy girl (points to self) loves the convenience of a bag that stands upright for easy grabbage. I plan to travel with this backpack when I fly home this Christmas instead of bringing a bulky tote bag on the plane.",[],B001OC5JKY,B001OC5JKY,AGGZ357AO26RQZVRLGU4D4N52DZQ,1290278495000,True,18

5.0,Love the headphones - great range,These are fantastic headphones and I love that i can have my cell phone plugged in at a central location in my house and walk around the house and still listen to music or my book. the range for me is about 30' and the headphones will disconnect if i go outside and then reconnect when i get close to my phone again. If my phone is in my pocket it will stay connected where ever i go. I love listening to things without being attached or tethered to my phone. It also makes it harder for my kids to pull the earphones out of my ears when there is no long cord attached to my phone. I love the 1 click pause feature so i can quickly pause what i am listening to talk to someone (i don't have to go find my phone and swipe and pause). They are comfortable and stay on really well for my ears. I have taken them running and they stayed on as well. I had an issue about 1 year after I bought the headphones and the customer service was wonderful and understanding. really great product and I will continue to purchase and recommend these to my friends.,[],B07BND376H,B09S6Y5BRG,AGCI7FAH4GL5FI65HYLKWTMFZ2CQ,1541356831659,True,9

I find it works better with my frankenquest adapters at holding things in place than the stock foam. It bounces on my face less ands doesn't require as much tension.<br />2. This does seem to work better at keeping my face cool that just the silicone covers for the stock foam.<br />Negatives:<br />1. There is still a bit of light bleed out the sides, but it's not bad unless you are in a really bright room and you can only tell in dark scenes. I have seen other adapters including side cushions to repair this issue.<br />2. The nose piece doesn't stay on well, and when it does it presses hard and leaves a mark on my nose. It's still rubber so it's not painful, but there has to be a better solution. Maybe cut it lower or make it a bit more flexible.

I finally connected my phone to my Ipad TrackR app. Of course, I got Alexa easily to find my phone (and ring it). However, when I tried to use find my phone on my Ipad it rang my Ipad (not my phone) so, I will now have to go back to square one with that. But, again, my original intent was to use with my keys. I did get that to work with my ipad, but I wanted Alexa to do it as well. I cannot get Alexa to find my keys with the TrackR device attached, only my Ipad can do it.

5.0,Love my new Solo Messenger Bag!!!,"I absolutely love this Solo Pro Aegis! I previously had a beautiful backpack style case that I bought on Amazon last year that, when I looked at it, seemed to be everything I wanted. Well, after traveling internationally 3 times in the last 12 months, I needed to get something else. I found the fact that I would have to juggle suitcase, purse and backpack while going through customs, airports, etc, it just became impossible. I found myself unable to put the backpack on once I was getting through the lines so I ended up holding it most of the time which was just awful. This new Solo is fantastic. It is easy to swing over my shoulder, leaving my hands free. It's also so much thinner than my backpack, but with what seems to be far more storage capabilities than my old one. Pockets galore, padded beautifully, plenty of room for my 15&quot; laptop, bluetooth keyboard, mouse along with my Ipad pro and accessories. Also has plenty of room for other stuff as well (papers, etc). On top of it all it has extra security for me to feel safe in keeping my credit cards and other identity items close to me and with a security block.

First, I must admit I am a 50 something technically challenged woman (often times), so maybe it was just me. I easily was able to download the apps and get it to work with my IPhone. It was cool asking Siri to turn it on and off. I really wanted this for Echo and Alexa. Try as I might, I couldn't do it. I downloaded Wink and synced Alexa with Wink. And then synced IHome with Wink. Could not get Alexa to find the smart plug at all (and I spent hours today on and off trying to do this). I will try again tomorrow. However, I will tell you nothing is easy with this. I found no instructions for use with Alexa in the package and had to surf the web for solutions. Seems like a lot of work to be able to simply turn on a light with my phone. Also, I could not get Siri to do this remotely (while I was out and about), so I assume it only works if you are in the proximate area for programming.

Has a lot of features that I really don't need (I am interested in tracking the miles I run primarily), so I see this watch primarily for a 20 or 30 something who love new gadgets. I personally, prefer my old Fitbit, but that's only because I am not the techy type.

1.0,Won't last,"Great relatively inexpensive television. I did not have any kind of line at the bottom (which one of the other reviewers had experienced). This is a very light set and I was easily able to maneuver the box inside and set up all by myself. The picture is crystal clear and the contrast is simply remarkable at a price like this. I set this up in my bedroom and was super impressed with the quality of this Polaroid television. I am sure the reason for the lightweight feature of this television may largely be due to plastic pieces, but I don't notice it when set up. I also find the sound quality of this set impressive, too (no need for me to attach my sound bar). All and all, very impressed. If the price on this goes down even further over the holidays, I would jump on it. I will be keeping my out for the sales as I would love to get one for my son.<br /><br />10-04-2015 Update: After initially setting this television up in my bedroom, I moved it to my guest bedroom and hadn't used it again until last night.

There are no indentations to grip the mouse and it is difficult to click on any area that you are trying to. Navigation/movement of the mouse is ok, it's the clicking that is difficult to do (and it becomes quite annoying to say the least).

I love the wireless speakers and have them spread out over about a 25 ft. area. The sound is incredible with strong lows and highs. The 3D Blu-ray player is also flawless in quality and completes my home theater system to a T.

4.0,Nice camera but way overpriced,"Let me start by stating that I received this camera as part of the Vine program. I have used it for almost 2 months now exclusively and this review is based on this. I also own a Canon Rebel (which I used for real photographic ventures like special events, concerts and travel) and a Sony Cyber-shot (which I had be using for more 'quickie' picture taking as it is smaller and I can fit it in my pocket).  Although I found the picture quality far superior with the Fujifilm XF1 than the Sony, the complexity of the Fujifilm along with the high price tag, make it seem like it should be comparable to what I paid for the Rebel. To be honest, the picture quality and the flexibility/lenses of the Rebel far outweigh the Fujifilm XF1. The way I look at it, the XF1 is a really nice point and shoot. If you are looking for a quality, sleek, stylish camera which is a step above the other pocket sized cameras (especially when it comes to low-light picture capability), and you have several $100 to spend, then the investment may be worth it for you. I just think that if you are a true photographer and want to take quality pictures in the $500 price range, then go for an entry level DSLR which will give you the flexibility of interchanging lenses. I am rating this as a 4 star because, honestly, it's a great camera.

First, although the picture looks good, the item is cheaply made plastic, which I guess would normally be ok for something like this (although to me in the picture it looked a little sturdier). The 30 point connection does not work well. I had to rock my phone several times to get it start charging (it wasn't easy to see if it is connected properly). Having a charging light on the base would have been a nice-have, but of course there isn't one. I then tried my ipod in there. I found that a little easier to connect, but still takes several attempts of getting it to the right angle to make it work right.

4.0,"Great camera for the money - good, solid features","I want to begin by saying I own a Canon Rebel which I love and use all the time. I wanted to get a second camera which also took great pictures but that was lower priced and better for me to take on extended travel without all my lenses). The Fujifilm FinePix is a good camera. For around the $200 price range, you get a high quality camera with good picture taking quality (14 MP, EVF, 30 times zoom capability). It is easy to learn and use and makes an excellent entry level camera with high quality features (would make a great graduation gift for a high schooler to introduce them to a higher level of picture taking than a simple point and shoot). It is a little large and plasticy, but overall I do recommend it for a good second camera or, as I mentioned, to someone looking to enter the SLR market (but not ready to spend $600+).",[],B006TR0FCQ,B00A4QXIRM,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1349799652000,False,3
5.0,Great old school Shelf System,"Great for school dorms or apartments, this Panasonic SC-AKX14 stereo delivers great bass and sound quality. It's attractive and sizable (not compact) and would impress most of the younger set. I think this would make a great present this Christmas to students in college as it would truly rock (especially given its strong wattage) the dorm house. I called this 'old school' because it reminds me a bit of the old boom boxes they used to have around. Of course, with today's MP3 players with their compact sizes and use of wireless speakers, the need for a CD player of this size might be slight outdated. However, it's sound is impressive and reasonably priced for the quality.",[],B007GFX798,B007GFX798,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1345646375000,False,5
5.0,Great wireless set for any desktop,"I love this logitech set. Not sure why some people have less than stellar reviews on this as I have had nothing but positive things to say since I started using it several months back. I love the fact that the additional wires that used to support my keyboard and mouse are now gone, leaving my desktop far cleaner and organized. I tend to leave the mouse and keyboard on 24x7 most of the time (I forget to shut them off) and I have yet to have to change batteries since first setting it up. If there were any downside at all, it would be that I honestly wish more vendors would make these keyboards with lit backgrounds (so it is easier to see the keys in poorly lit/morning hours).",[],B003VAGXZC,B003VAGXZC,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1336571123000,False,0
4.0,Amazing sound - It's a Bose!,"First for the pros: Beautiful looking, sleek, shiny and artfully designed to fit any style room. Relatively easy to install (being a non-techy person I actually followed the verbal audio instructions easily and flawlessly). The wireless woofer is an asset with no ugly wires (as my previous Panasonic system had)and amazing (loud) bass tones. The sound is amazing (which I expected from Bose). The cons: I am having a difficult time using the remote control which is supposed to act as an all-in-one device (supposedly so I can get rid of all these little dedicated remotes I have for the DVD, television, cable, etc). For whatever reason, the device sticks frequently or doesn't respond to commands and I end up reverting back to the old standby remotes. I am disappointed that a company like Bose couldn't have perfected something like this better. But then I keep thinking, maybe I did something wrong, not sure. The only other con is the price. If this was in a $700-1000 range I would tell you to snatch it up in a heartbeat. But for $1500 you are honestly paying for the name (and the status symbol bragging rights to say you own a Bose system). Wait for the price to come down and grab it. You honestly won't be disappointed with the sound quality nor the set up (and, who knows, maybe it's me in not being able to get the remote to work properly with all my other devices).",[],B005OB1TU0,B005OB1TU0,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1331156191000,False,4
3.0,"Not what I was expecting - Ok, but overpriced","First the disclaimer that I got this in the Vine program. That being said, I always try to be fair, honest and objective in my reviews. That being said, I am a little disappointed in this Sharp system. As the ad specified this was good for small spaces, I set it up in my bedroom (as I have a 32"" Samsung flatscreen there with no additional sound support). Here are the pros: Set up was not difficult (although it did take me close to an hour to do by myself with the instructions). Sound is clear, bass tones are adjustable and I found the overall quality sufficient for a small/medium sized room. Here are the cons: First, as another reviewer has written, the fan in the bass unit is audible. Make sure you set it somewhere further enough away from where you are sitting or you will be distracted (regardless of how loud you set the speaker) by the hum. The other thing I wish Sharp would have done is make this a wireless device. I think this is why it took me so long to set it up trying to hide/wind the wires inside the carpeting so as not to be seen. To me, wireless is the way to go particularly with a sound system. I actually had bought another unit for a set up in my den http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MME6S4/ref=wms_ohs_product which is a Panasonic. Cost half the price of this unit and I honestly prefer it over the Sharp.

4.0,Great Home Theater System,"The Panasonic SC-HTB15 is a great Home Theater System. It was unfortunate that I was not able to install this myself due to the way my current Panasonic Viera television is set up (it was wall mounted by a professional) so I needed to call in someone to do this for me. I watched the tech set it up and seemed to be relatively easy to do (once he was able to get to the wall mounted television). If I had the television on a standard table mount I am sure I coud have easily set this up myself. Once installed, all I can say is 'Wow' to the quality of the sound. The technician set up the speakers similar to the way it is displayed on the Amazon page, one on each side of the television wall mounted. To me, the sound rivaled any 4 speaker system out there and fro, the second it was turned on, filled my entire room with beautiful crystal clear sound. If there were any drawbacks at all it would be that I wish the system was wireless (so I didn't have to go through the expense of the installation). But, as I mentioned, I do have a wall mount which is my own drawback I guess. I would recommend this system to anyone to use in a family room or living room with a large screen tv (I love the Viera model so I am slightly prejudiced when it comes to the Panasonic name).",[],B005K69PLE,B005K69PLE,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1325701900000,False,1
4.0,Does what it is intended for - could be better,"Got this in the Vine program to compliment the IPad2 I had bought a few months back. It is adhesive backed which, in my opinion, does not make it the easiest to use device. I had thought we could use it for my Kindle cookbook collection, which I have. However, once it was set into place, it was not adjustable (so my husband and kids couldn't easily view it at their heights for other purposes). This would have been far better designed to have strong magnets so you could adjust it for everyone's needs. Outside of this, the fridge mount worked as designed and is easily set up. Just think they should have thought the design of this through better.",[],B005NHR6MU,B005NHR6MU,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1324483176000,False,0
2.0,Definitely not an ipod,"Let me start by saying I got the Philip's Gogear as part of the Vine program. I have always used an Ipod, so this was new for me. I really had serious issues with using this device. First for the positives: it's an attractive size and the display is clear. On the downside, I found it difficult to navigate. I also experience, while running, the jostling of the settings (meaning that all of a sudden it skipped to the next song). I had a real problem with that, so I stopped using it. Figure I can give the device to a kid or someone who doesn't jog or require any kind of non-static device. So, I rated this two stars thinking that maybe someone who doesn't exercise and is simply listening to music might have a use for this, but I am returning to my Apple.",[],B0035JJJR8,B004DNWCZ6,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1314193720000,False,0
5.0,Excellent cover for my new IPAD2,"To be honest, I got my IPAD about 2 months ago and purchased a bluetooth keyboard case (from Amazon of course). I was finding it to be a bit cumbersome to travel locally with, like going to the stores (although I admit it is nice to be able to type on a keyboard). Anyway, I was looking for an alternative case to be able to use as just a case (nothing to do with a keyboard). I saw this offered to me in Vine and figure I could give it an honest review. To start with, I didn't know if I would like the red plaid design of the cover. It is just gorgeous and I am so happy I got this. It looks smart (for either a man or a woman). The cover in general is padded and my IPAD2 is well protected. Inside there is a secure holders which snuggly fits my IPAD and on the alternate side on the cover is a side pocket for document storage and an elastic band which will keep any other items in place (i.e. a small calculator etc). I would see this as a great accessory for a business person who would like a little bit of storage with their case and it behaves almost like a small portfolio case. The back  corner of the cover has a perfectly fit hole which allows you to continue to use the camera feature while the IPAD 2 stays snug in the case. I honestly have nothing but good things to say about the Marco cover. It looks smart and protects my IPAD2, all while giving me some handy side features. To top it all off it has the Smart magnetic feature which puts the IPAD to sleep when closed and wakes it up when opened (saves battery life). I highly recommend, this is a great cover for all!!!",[],B0051GN9NS,B0058GAOO8,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1312594386000,False,1
5.0,Great SLR camera for the money,"Ok, so let me preface this by saying that when I was in my 20's I owned a great SLR camera and dragged it around with me everywhere. I even used to take a load of pictures at rock concerts, had interchangeable lenses, a variety of lenses... well, you get the 'picture'. I was a 'professional' amateur. Flash ahead to the 1990's and on, I have a family and start to look for new gadgets. I owned several point and click cameras over the past 20 years, concentrating mainly on small sizes and portability. I loved the fact that I could slip these cameras into my pockebook and pack up the kids to the park (without a huge camera bag). Unfortunately, the pictures were 'ok' but nothing like the quality I had when I owned the old fashioned SLR. Well, now that I am 50'ish and my kids are grown and gone, I figured I would treat myself to a new camera, in particular this Canon Rebel. All I can say is 'wow'! I love it, love it, love it. Having owned it for over a year now (bought it on Amazon but just never got around to writing a review), I have purchased several interchangeable lenses and even a separate flash (although it comes with it's own built in one, I prefer to control the flash myself). The Canon Rebel gives me the quality of the pictures I was used to and with the stabilization, my pictures come out clear and focused every time. I have even started going back to concerts (ok, so they are the same artists I was following when I was much younger) and I am feeling like a pro again. I have also gotten into wildlife and nature pictures and some of the pictures I have taken of flowers could match up with any professional photographer.

I usually take two of these cards with me when I go on vacation and, although I take a ton of pictures, usually still come back with some room on the cards. I highly recommend this brand and size of memory card for any amateur photographer out there.

Let me start by saying it is super easy to set up (batteries) and programming the destinations (although maybe it's simply because I have been using a variety of GPS systems over the past 5 years or so in cars and handheld). This item is perfect for carrying in a pocket, is very lightweight and is extremely user friendly. I used it locally here all last weekend (various places in NJ and Pennsylvania) and it functioned beautifully.

Earbuds, as has been mentioned in other reviews, are far superior to the ones that come standard from the Ipod. I didn't like the screen display, too small for these 50 year old eyes. All in all, it's ok, which is why I gave it 4 stars. It does what it needs to do. But, to be honest, if I was going to spend $140 on an MP3 player, I would much rather go with the Apple. Seems that, although their store is a monopoly, it's much easier to get music using the Apple and the screen size (and now camera capabilities) are far superior on the Ipod.

4.0,Probably great for a professional,"I was in the market for a new camera and when I saw this bag in the Vine program I thought I would snap it up. I did get my Canon Rebel (thanks Amazon!) and several lenses to boot (in preparation for my trip this month to Israel). Although the quality of the bag is good, the size to me is really inconvenient. First, it is shaped like a back pack, which makes it kind of big. I am not sure if I am going to be able to bring this on the plane with me (as the boarding guidelines state 1 carry-on and I have a purse and laptop I am bringing). In addition, there are straps and zippered compartments which are not really conveniently placed. It's not an easy bag to get your gear in and out of. I see this bag as a great tool to have if you are backpacking as you have a place to hang a tripod and there is a small storage area if you wanted to bring a snack with you. But for someone like me, who wants it for sightseeing/traveling, I think a more conventional camera bag would have done the trick better.",[],B0036AWR8E,B00BWH2SWI,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1286448109000,False,0

It's not just a printer, but so much more, and for less than $100, it couldn't be much better of a deal. Now the bad part: I am not technically, computer inclined. I spent over an hour trying to get this to work wirelessly. My goal was to take the printer and stick it in a closet and out of view so it wouldn't be cluttering up my office space and would be functional without being in sight. I used the CD rom which came with the printer and read the directions from start to finish several times. Still couldn't get it to work.

Couldn't review it until I actually took it on my vacation to California, and cruise to Mexico. Being that I was going to be doing part of my vacation on land and the other on sea, I was ecstatic to know that I could use this camera all around for the whole trip. And, to top it all off, I didn't have to lug around my regular digital camera. I had been addicted to my little Flip Camcorder previously, but now I am taking the Sanyo everywhere! Not only was the picture quality fantastic, the audio/stereo sound was almost as good as being there! I love how versatile this camera is and how easily it is to hold and operate (especially considering how technically challenged I am). Within a few minutes of opening the box, I was operating it and taking pictures. Underwater, although a little trickier, was just as easy. Snorkeling in Cabo San Lucas was incredible and I have the most beautiful pictures of underwater sea life that I will be able to appreciate forever. I didn't think I was going to like the color of this camera (think school bus), but actually I found it to be 'hip' looking and I got a lot of compliments from people asking what kind of camera it was. I even took pictures of everyone at the Captain's dinner and have shared them on a website for all the new friends I made.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the Sanyo VPC-WH1 HD Waterproof camcorder for any one who is looking for an easy to use, versatile camera, that you can take and use every where.

Ok, I admit being in my 50's that I am computer illiterate. But my son, in a matter of minutes, had loaded the CD rom and everything set up to go. The first time we used it I was amazed with the quality of the sound and the video. I felt as if the two of us were in the same room, never mind half way around the world from each other. I also found it very easy to use and was surprised to learn that I didn't have to sit immediately in front of the camera to make it work (I actually walked around the room while chatting with him). I also liked the way the Logitech folds up when I am done so it is out of the way until needed. I would highly recommend the Logitech C600 for newbies to this type of technology and realize the valuable uses you can put this camera to. I am thrilled that I am able now to have weekly calls over seas and chat with my son and his wife and see them at the same time.

Long story short, with Macs being way to expensive at this economic time, I got him a netbook. Of course, it took some getting used to. One of his his principal complaints was trying to navigate the smaller 10"" netbook. When I saw this Verbatim 96781 Nano Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse I jumped at it. It was small enough that he could leave it plugged into his port without having to disconnect it when he was packing it up to take with him. Given his track record of losing stuff, to me that was a great feature. The ergonomic design of the mouse is not too big or small and fits perfectly for him to use. I know I never see him using the netbook anymore without the wireless mouse, so I know it's a tremendous asset for him. I am in the market now for monitor and maybe even a docking station now, so he will be able to actually set up a desk in his dorm with the netbook.

5.0,Another Great Flip Product,"I purchased my first Flip Camcorder about a year and a half ago when I was planning my trip to Ireland. I bought a 60 minute basic Flip and was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to use and the great quality of the video. The only downside I saw with the original was the fact that it was only 60 minutes. Enter the new Flip UltraHD Camcorder which has a 120 minute capability. When I first received it, I couldn't wait to try it out. The quality of the video is beautiful and the HD capability really makes a huge difference in my pictures. I love the fact that the camera is smaller than my original camera and that I know can film up to 120 minutes. When I took the camera to Ireland, I found that a 60 minute recording just couldn't be used for a day's worth of sightseeing. I found myself taking short snippets, afraid that I would use up the entire capability until I was able to get back to the hotel and offload the recording. The short vignettes really came across choppy and I was yearning for a larger capacity. This 120 minute model, besides having better resolution, allows me the ability to take the camera with me full day to record. I haven't seen the problem with battery life yet (as I have seen others comment on), so I can't say anything negative.

1.0,DO NOT BUY,"PLEASE PLEASE, do not buy these cameras and the doorbell. I did not listen. Now I am not going to use a lot of big words to describe the problem. I am just going to tell you the truth. I am 70 years old and I purchased these cameras because I live alone and I wanted security. I am not secure and I do not feel secure. I purchased due to all the advertisements and because Shaq endorsed them. They do not work and the customer service really sucks. One day I was put on hold for 45 minutes then hung up on. The supervisors are no help at all. I purchased 3 floodlight cameras and 1 doorbell camera. They all are malfunctioning. The doorbell does not alert until the person is long gone. What is the purpose if the incident is over before you can even see it. Then you cannot even pull the incident up for about 4-5 minutes! You have to wait to see who was at your door and that's not safe. in 4-5 minutes someone could already be in your house!! I have horrible neighbors who are interfering with one of the floodlight cameras and literally making it go off every 1-3 minutes. I've called ring over 52 times since October of 2019. They cannot or will not resolve the issue, other than tell me the camera cannot be tampered with. I KNOW THAT IS NOT CORRECT! If you buy these cameras buy at your own risk. I am here to tell you that they do not work and customer service will not help you when they fail and they will fail!!!! Shame on you Shaq O' Neal. Shame on you Amazon for buying and selling this mess !!!!!!!  On my last recent call to Ring I was told that the cameras do not work in real time. The representatives say whatever they want to try and get you to hang up. I'm 70 not senile. Someone named Richmond told me that! The commercials show the people walking up, you activating the sound and talking to the person. One of My problems is the people are already gone before the camera actually activates. I would look into buying something else if I could afford it. You have a choice. DO NOT BUY RING. Do not be tricked like I was.",[],B01DM6BDA4,B07G5ZG3Q4,AFUOYIZBU3MTBOLYKOJE5Z35MBDA,1583749444226,True,0
1.0,THIS IS FRAUD.,"I AM 70 YEARS OLD AND I DO NOT LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT THESE CAMERAS. I AM STUCK WITH THEM BECAUSE I ALREADY INVESTED WAY TOO MUCH MONEY IN THEM ALREADY AND I CANNOT AFFORD ANYTHING ELSE ON A RETIREMENT SALARY. AMAZON AND RING ARE JIPPING CUSTOMERS. THEY SHOW A COMMERCIAL WHERE THE OWNERS IS TALKING TO CRIMINALS IN REAL TIME. WHEN IN REALITY THE PERSON HAS COME AND GONE BEFORE YOU EVEN SEE THEM. EVEN ADDING THE CHIME DID NOT WORK. THE CHIME DOES NOT EVEN NOTIFY YOU UNTIL THE PERSON HAS GONE. SO, I SAY WHAT USE ARE THEY. THAT IS FALSE ADVERTISING ON RING AND AMAZON'S BEHALF. I WOULD EXPECT IT FROM RING BUT NOT AMAZON!! THEY BLAME IT ON THE INTERNET SPEED THAT YOU HAVE. INTERNET SPEED IS NOT THE PROBLEM! IT IS THE RING CAMERA'S FAULT. I HAVE ALL MY CAMERAS SET TO PEOPLE ONLY MODE. THE GARAGE CAMERA GOES OFF OVER 280 TIMES A DAY. DID YOU HEAR ME.... ONE DAY IT WENT OFF 381 TIMES. I HAD TO SIT THERE AND DELETE 381 VIDEO'S. SOMETIMES THEY RECORD AND SOMETIMES THEY DO NOT. YESTERDAY IT SKIPPED 4 WHOLE HOURS OF RECORDINGS. AND IT WAS NOT OFFLINE, IT JUST STOPPED RECORDING. THE LIGHTS ON ONE OF THE CAMERAS KEEPS FLICKERING OFF AND ON AND IS NO LONGER AS BRIGHT AS IT USED TO BE. THE CAMERAS I AM TALKING ABOUT ARE ALL LESS THAN 2 YEARS OLD. THE LIVE VIEW OFTEN DOES NOT WORK. These cameras just do not work!!! THEY ARE A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. BUY THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!!!  I PURCHASED THEM FOR SECURITY. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE AT ALL. I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS PACKAGES STOLEN OFF MY FRONT PORCH AND IT DOES NOT NOTIFY ME UNTIL THE CRIMINALS ARE RUNNING DOWN THE STREET. IT NEVER SHOWS OR NOTIFIES ME WHEN THEY ARE WALKING UP ON MY PROPERTY. ON 10-08-20, A MAN STOPPED BY MY FRONT LAWN,POSED, AND WALKED UP ON MY PROPERTY, OFF THE SIDEWALK AND ACTUALLY LOOKED IN MY WINDOW. THE CHIME WENT OFF WHEN THE WAS HALFWAY BACK DOWN THE SIDEWALK AND CROSSING THE STREET. I AM TRYING TO GIVE YOU AS THROUAL A REVIEW AS I CAN. THEY DO NOT WORK AS THEY ARE ADVERTISED TO DO. THE CRIMINALS WILL BE IN AND OUT OF YOUR HOUSE 🏡 BEFORE YOU ARE EVEN NOTIFIED THAT THEY ARE THERE! SO I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THESE CAMERAS TO ANYONE! IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO GO TO ANOTHER SYSTEM. I WOULD IF I COULD AFFORD IT. RING, SHAQUILLE O'NEAL AND AMAZON ARE FRAUDENTLY ADVERTISING THESE CAMERAS TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL NOT. I WANT THE SYSTEM TO WORK THE WAY RING STATED THAT IT WOULD, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS SYSTEM.",[],B0722R3WV5,B07G5YXYFL,AFUOYIZBU3MTBOLYKOJE5Z35MBDA,1567269220576,True,22

5.0,good purchase,"Lots of research -<br />Needed a 47 inch HDTV for living room - old style TV shelves built in to include TV position that was too.<br />Based on reviews - caught a quick sales price opportunity and pulled the trigger. So happy with purchase.<br />1. Had to search online for the best picture calibration. Out of the box the picture was not good. Comparing it to our LG 60 plasma.<br />2. Wanted and LED/LCD type TV - but a good picture and price. Our LG plasma has been flawless.<br />3. Wanted a thin TV with a good picture for 3D and wanted it to be passive this time. we have the active 3D downstairs.<br />So far the 8600 has meet our expectations and exceeded some. Once we got the picture calibrated CNET review.... its all been very good.<br />TV is lightweight - we're currently using the TV stand but have plans to mount it on an articulating bracket once we can modify the TV cubby.<br />Remote is their magic remote. our first experience w/ the magic remote was with our plasma (2010), used it twice and stored it.<br />since this was the only remote, had no choice. It was easy to use and get the 8600 updated (firmware), online - Ethernet and change settings for calibration. but since then we only use the remote to turn on the TV since we have DirecTV and use that remote for the channels plus have a Harman Kardon receiver that we use for volume etc. most likely we'll be setting one or both of those up as universal remotes. only make sense.<br /><br />we only used the audio speakers on the 8600 for two weeks, decent sounding but not going to fill the room. we use our Harman Kardon as the workhorse now. once you go HDMI and the receiver the 8600 speakers become inop.<br /><br />the good news - a decently strong person can lift the set by themselves to set it in position or move it to make changes. the picture is good, 3D is decent, not eye popping like active 3D does but good enough for our living room and much cheaper with almost free 3D passive glasses.<br /><br />con - not much we can say.... wish I had got the 55&#34; but the extra few hundred would have put me in the dog house especially when the TV would not have fit inside the tv cubby.",[],B006ZH0L2E,B0078YGN34,AG35BKPUEUMX7LV5YLOQ5YCQ3GOA,1364582421000,True,1
5.0,Perfect fit for Living Room & 5.1 channels,"Needed a receiver that would allow us to have a decent sub (not expensive), fill the room with sound efficiently and have enough HDMI hookups for DirecTV, 3D Blu Ray, gaming when needed, that had airplay and was easy to use remote.<br />Plus was at a decent price.<br /><br />H/K AVR1700 met those expectations. It was between this, Yamaha 473 or 573 units or Pioneer 1122. I went w/ Harman Kardon based on reviews, price and expectations of use. I have a 7.2 system that can shake the house in the basement for sports, movies etc. Our LG 47LM8600 would be matched to the system and we realized we didn't need anything more than 5.1 for the Living Room based on setup downstairs and with our L/R being somewhat small and open to dining/kitchen this unit would be a good match.<br /><br />1. I missed getting this at the $200 sale price, but willingly paid the $270 price to get it via prime and have the Living Room up and running for wife and family. I would expect as the 2013 receivers come out the sales price will return.<br /><br />2. First set of speakers was the Polk Audio RM6750 HT speaker set. Unfortunately 2 were shot rather quickly. RMA returned to Newegg and got different speakers to match receiver from Amazon. Polk Audio PSW505 Sub (which works great with the 1700's LFE sub Hookup), BIC Center channel to match my Axiom M2 Bookshelves I brought down from the loft game system and the two additional Polk Audio RM6750 satellites for the rears.  - H/K auto setup worked like a champ for surround sound, but for our setup I tweaked it a bit for the subwoofer. Easily done in manual mode.<br /><br />3. Setup the Panasonic 3D Blu Ray via HDMI - no issues, You can even match names to HDMI inputs on back so they match the buttons on remote.<br /><br />4. Setup DirecTV inputs (SAT/Cable) - no issues worked well and we can get 5.1 sound on channels that have it encoded.<br /><br />5. HDMI out to LG tv. didn't' realize doing this at first took away the TV's sound. Which is OK since receiver sounds better than plain tv. it just requires another remote to be used for the process. Later today I'll look at making either or both the DirecTV / Harman Kardon Remotes universal for the system and thus streamline the 4 remotes we have out.<br /><br />6. Remote is OK, buttons are somewhat readable for an older couple but reading glasses help til I have them memorized. switching things around and getting to H/K's setup required downloading and reading parts of the manual. Yes it doesn't come with the system. I had to download it. 8mb file<br /><br />Overall - Very good purchase so far (3 weeks). Good sound - probably a bit more tweaking to do yet. Since it feels like the volume is about half way up for a presentable sound. was same w/ Polk Audio speakers too.<br />Easy to use, remote is decent (not great), wife said it looks good and there aren't a bunch of buttons for the grandson to see and go and try to push. it seems streamlined in looks.<br /><br />cons - Manual had to be downloaded to figure out a couple of buttons and &#34;How - to's&#34;.

Fortunately, I don’t have to carry my IPad around like  some people do for their job.  I use mine mostly at a table or desk.  I’m happy that this cover has 3 grooves (instead of the 2 that many covers offer) to hold the IPad at different angles while being worked on, but it would be nice if they were deeper because when working on the IPad when it’s in the vertical position, it sometimes slides out of the groove and slams down.",[],B08XM8H5TM,B08XLXS9P4,AHHBXLYVZCDODBPA2NTPSACJD6CA,1628227370852,True,1

It seems like they're not deep enough. Two corners  snap in, the other 2 don't grip at all.

The alarm was really the main reason for the purchase. My other clock radio finally gave out after many years and I thought this would be a great, updated replacement.  My husband worked on it for a couple of hours and didn't get much further than I.  I really love the time projection on the ceiling or wall.

You have to be able to adjust them to size for each human wrist.  Then I have found that the 'smooth' bands don't stay adjusted - they slip.  This one is sort of thicker, has some texture and body. I am calling it braided, but it isn't - just sorta looks like it is.  I have found this one to stay adjusted fairly well.  Much better than the smooth bands.  I bought 2 different color variations and I like them.  They were well represented in the photos - meaning what you see is what you get.  All in all, these are good in my opinion.

You can set a regular time to 'run' the frame or manually turn it off and/or on.  You can 'shuffle' OR play all your uploaded pics.  You do not get to choose the 'fade' that happens between pics, but you do get to choose how long each pic stays on the frame before moving to the next pic. Picture quality is pretty good - about as good as the pics you download on to it.  It's close to an 8x10 frame.  Not sure why they call it a 'touch screen' cause I can't figure out what you can do by touching the screen - but ok.

It was super easy - plugged it in, a box came up on my TV that asked if I wanted to update and format - I clicked yes and that was it.  It was ready for transfer of saved material. The drive itself is approx 5:x4""x 3/4"".  It is black and has a little flashing light when it's being used.  I had things sorted on my Hopper in ""files"".  So far, I cannot figure out how to make folders on the hard drive, so everything is just mixed on the hard drive - that means looking thru about 200 titles - Eh - but the point of the hard drive for us is to save the content if we have to replace the Hopper at some point.  It is easy to move the files back and forth.. And you can play the movies from the hard drive.  It did take quite a while to transfer, we had about 50% of our Hopper memory - a number of hours.  But no biggee to me.  So far, I am happy with my purchase, however, time will tell.

Comes with a stabilizer screw that I highly recommend you install so that you can easily unplug stuff without pulling the extender out.  It also has a soft light frame around the front side - comes on when dark.  Very handy for under then cupboards where it can be dark.  The only ""down"" side is how far it sticks out from the wall - a good 2 1/2"" or more just eyeballing it.

4.0,goose neck cell phone/device holder,"I was really hoping to love love this... and I do like it..<br />PROS<br />- Like having a third arm/hand<br />- holds in place you choose<br />- black or white color options  (I purchased black for husband and white for me)<br />- table clamp is easy to attach if you have a perfectly flat table (top and bottom) up to 2"" thick or so - using twisting tube attached to the base. -NOTE:  There is a ""con"" to this as well.<br />- The coil is very, very difficult to manipulate.  BUT it once you get it there, it stays exactly where you place it.<br />CONS<br />- the clamp is really really stiff and difficult to stretch enough to hold your phone or device.  If you have any strength issues, this might not be the best choice.  Also, they edges will pinch you if you accidentally get your fingers in the way of the spring loaded clips.<br />- The table clamp only works with tables that are flat on top and bottom.  The place I wanted to clamp on has a groove underneath and my husband had to make a wooden block of sorts for the table clamp to work.<br /><br />Overall, I like the stand - but the engineering that is required to make a strong, stable holder, also makes it difficult to use.

1.0,Samsung 32 Art TV,"I am going to provide a list of pros and cons... but to summarize, I am really disappointed.  The most disappointing thing... a HUGE BLACK box that you must use.  They ""say"" it can be flush mounted to the wall - but NOT without a giant black brick below it.  There are multiple photos in the ads of the TV ""in use"" but not a single one that shows that ugly black box!!!  Here are my thoughts...<br />PRO...  (and they are weak)<br />- A fairly good picture.<br />- Mediocre sound.<br />- The art option - which is also on the con - so it kinda wipes this one out. You chose a piece and it will stay on for up to 4 hours.  There is a setting to adjust 1, 2, 3 or 4 hours.<br />- The best ""pro""?  The white frame was easily installed (it has magnets- but the little plastic pieces to secure the outer plastic to the frame are SUPER hard to secure.  Good luck.  I have provided a large number of photos to show all that I am outlining.<br />- It's a smart TV - which means you can hook up to your wifi and watch your netflix, prime, hulu, disney+.... but I will say I had to login my ""samsung acct"" in order to ""load"" my Amazon prime.  Really?  Just more ways for Samsung to follow you - you have to agree to them tracking/tracing you.  GRRRR... I should move this to the con list... another pro/con that wipe each other out.<br />CONS....<br />- First and foremost - that UGLY black box.  Approximately 9""x4""x1 1/2"" .  You cannot use the tv without it.  The power cord plugs into it.  If you planned on flush mounting (which is included with the TV - the most complicated and awful install imaginable) you will have an ugly black box under the TV.<br />- We had to purchase an adjustable frame to mount to the wall in order to hide the black box behind it.  AND a white power cord so that the ""showing"" cord is at least white.  I may hire an electrician to put a plug in behind it but at this point you have to wonder how much more I will spend to make this work as the photos all show.  GRRRR<br />- The remote. Good luck getting the back open to put the batteries in!!  It doesn't just ""slide"" open as the only direction on this is printed on the remote - and arrow pointing to the end of the remote.  If you find yourself with one of these TVs - here's a hint... get a dime.  Gently work into the top where the red plastic (the infrared tip) and the white body of the remote... wiggle it - ever so gently - back and forth... We eventually got it open.  Sheesh.<br />- We attached the ugly black box to the back of the TV which means we had to install the pull away mount to have room to do that.  So NO flush mount - which I was really looking forward to.<br />-  The art.... very pretty.  You get to see ONE - You MUST sign up, with a credit card, for a 31 day free trial to see any others.  It also will not allow you add your own photos unless you sign up.  It costs $4.99 a month after the trial.  There are a lot of art options - but is it worth $4.99.  I am on the fence.  Because it doesn't ""look"" as I was lead to believe it would look like - a flush mounted frame.<br /><br />-  Overall, I am hugely disappointed.  The ads are very, very misleading.  You will find in the official description the mention of a ""mini box""... which the black box clearly is not - ""mini"" in anyway.<br />Also, you should know that if you purchase an adjustable wall mounting kit, you will likely need to alter it to fit.  We had to rig with TWO mounting sets to make it work - The arms were not long enough.  We also tried a larger kit but it showed beyond the edges of the frame even though the mounting kit was meant for a 32"" TV.  Eh.<br />For those that are curious - this TV is manufactured in Mexico.<br />I would recommend looking for something else - unless you're cool with the ugly black box, a monthly fee for art and a lot of cord dangle.  We did make the choice to keep it - for now.  The thought of trying to repack it was overwhelming.  And in all honesty, we had NO IDEA how much we were going to have to go through to make this work.  If we could have seen into the future, we would have taken the 3 hours to repack and return it.  Live and learn.  I really hope our experience can help others avoid our mistake!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KF1CgdOeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KF1CgdOeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KF1CgdOeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Np9jxMS7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Np9jxMS7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Np9jxMS7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81S7V5vdaUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81S7V5vdaUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81S7V5vdaUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jP00Bp2IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jP00Bp2IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jP00Bp2IL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91eR8CbTrTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91eR8CbTrTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91eR8CbTrTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08BW4JTCG,B08BW4JTCG,AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA,1606669919698,True,48

5.0,Wall cord cover D Line,"If I could rate this 10 stars, I probably would... of course, time will be the true test!  I had some really ugly black cable cords just sitting along the floor.  Ugly to say the least.  So, I thought I would try these.  I just installed this along my base board (looks like quarter round) and it PERFECTLY holds and hides the cords.  I have two cable lines and a very small, flat land line cord in it... plenty of room for another cable if necessary.  There are no instructions.. but it's pretty easy.  There is a clear film on the outside/front - the back is a the self stick.  I was placing it on a painted, non textured wall - so it's very flat and the perfect material for this use.  A couple of things I learned as I was placing it... it worked best for me to cord up the holder before sticking to the wall - IMPORTANT - the sticky back is SOLID - NO repositioning at all. You want to make sure you have shoved up against the last one you placed as tightly as possible - you will still see the seam between each length - but less so if you carefully, firmly place each piece. Before removing the sticky back I ""placed"" it in position to see if I liked it and it would work.  Good thing, because once you remove the sticky back, it is NOT coming off without the sheet rock in torn pieces... just fyi.  I chose to position the opening part of the D tube facing up to make it easier to put another cord in or take one out... personal choice.  The ad says it is paintable and that is what I will try next.  Having said that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful - and I am eager to see if this will stand the test of time and use.. meaning.. cords pulled, etc.  I see no reason why you couldn't use this going up a wall (thinking of TV that has been hung on wall, etc - personal taste - but remember, the sticky tape is solid and won't be removed without tearing/damaging paint.  As for textured surfaces - like wall texture, I am thinking that as positive as this sticky tape is, as long as it's not too textured, it should work - but to be honest, I have not tried it on a textured surface.  As with most things that use a form of sticky tape, the smoother the surface, the better it will stick.)

They included the little attachment (the pokey connector) with each and every band.  If you go to the fitbit site, they will change you separately for each of those - so it's nice to not have to pull that connector out every time you want to change the color of your band.  I did order the &#34;large&#34; even though according to the size chart I could have ordered the &#34;small.&#34;  I like to wear it a bit looser.  They also include a clear &#34;holding&#34; piece to hold the strap.  I don't use those... but they are pretty thin... I don't think with will last for long if you change your bands a lot... but I am only guessing on that.  I really like being able to have choices so this fits the bill nicely.

5.0,Echo Dot 2nd gen,"So... I own both the tower and now several dots.  Of course the dots are more reasonably priced, however, the speaker ability is really where it's vastly different.  Obviously the tower is much better in the speaker department.  However, I did find that there is a cordless speaker you can buy to go with your 2nd gen dot that is an improvement and still at lower price point than the tower when combined with the cost of the dot. (Mokcao cordless speaker - amazon sells it too) Because the dots are so reasonably priced we have them in all 3 major rooms and use the cordless speaker to drop one dot in and take it outside to our sunroom when we like.  Over all, I am pleased with both my tower AND dots... but probably will stick to dot purchases in the future because of the price point.  I would say if you've been on the fence, the dot is well worth a try.  It's very easy to set up, you will need to download the app, also easy to follow step by step setups.

4.0,Bose sound bar,"After a lifetime of working in and around industrial sites my husband is a bit hard of hearing. We are constantly battling over the sound of the TV... I can hear normally, so when he puts the sound at level he can hear the conversations, it feels like it is blasting our my ear drums!  We've had several sets of headphones... they are uncomfortable and he then can't hear me if I am asking him something...  so we decided to give this a try.  A couple of things... neither of are &#34;techies&#34; and were able to plug into our newer (less than 2 months old Samsung 65&#34; TV) in an instant.  So that was good.  If you turn it on it is an amazing sound upgrade from your TV sound system.  Very noticeable.  When you push the little conversation icon which is supposed to &#34;enhance&#34; the conversation portion of the sound, it is noticeable.  Perhaps not as dramatic, but it helps.  We are able to find a happy medium.  You are able to adjust the bass when you don't feel like having the &#34;theater&#34; experience.  It is a &#34;bar&#34; that sits just below our wall - hung TV.  It's about 30 or so inches long and about 3&#34; tall.  It does have the Bose logo right in the middle.  At first I wasn't thrilled about looking at it ... but I find I don't notice it now and it sort of helps to hide the cords - bonus.  As noted on other reviews... you do have to click on the &#34;conversation icon&#34; to &#34;enhance&#34; the conversation sound every single time you turn it on.  It would be nice if it just stayed on that position.  Also, it would NOT &#34;learn&#34; my new Samsung blue ray player or my TV... so the &#34;universal remote&#34; thing is not really happening.  The remote is very large and cumbersome for just turning on and off the sound bar...  I even researched the internet to be certain I had the right &#34;universal codes&#34; for my DVD player...

5.0,Escort PASSPORT S55 Radar Detector,"First, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews...I purchased this detector for my sedan.  It is pretty large compared to my other detectors, but not terribly so.  I have provided some pics with a ruler so you can consider.  It came with an &#34;accessory&#34; kit... but honestly, it doesn't really need it as it comes with the cord and suction cup windshield attachment. It doesn't come with a lot of instructions, but it's pretty easy to figure out how settings work. I do find it nice to have a spare cord (in the accessory kit) - they don't last forever.  The cord comes with an easily reachable &#34;mute&#34; button.  Nice if your windshield is deep and therefore more inconvenient to reach.  Although, I usually keep my detectors on &#34;auto mute&#34; so after a few beeps it stops.It has a phone jack connector (see pic) which is different for me - but doesn't seem to effect it's use.  One of the nicest things I can say so far about this detector is that the screen is BRIGHT and inset.  So it is VERY easy to read when it's silent.  An important feature to me.  It also came with a lovely case.  I included a pic of the outside with measurements and an inside view of the case.  The suction cup windshield attachment has a very easy to use &#34;release&#34; button so you can leave the suction cups just were they need to be, collect the detector, place in it's case and take it with you.  In Arizona it gets super hot.  So even though I have a carport, I take my detector inside or with me 99% of the time if I will be longer than 30 minutes.  So far, it seems to do what a radar detector is meant to do, reminding me to take my foot off the gas pedal. It is also good to note that if you are hit with a laser, it's too late before you hear the alarm.  I never hesitate to update my reviews if updated info would be helpful. And just a reminder, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-BwjjsphL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-BwjjsphL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-BwjjsphL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715FbhJbm8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715FbhJbm8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715FbhJbm8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Em2IsWfgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Em2IsWfgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Em2IsWfgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GsR+d5DaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GsR+d5DaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GsR+d5DaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71toSGI2YgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71toSGI2YgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71toSGI2YgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8153YgayXCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8153YgayXCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8153YgayXCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816eiiWa-iL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816eiiWa-iL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816eiiWa-iL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fDFvOFS-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fDFvOFS-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fDFvOFS-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B016AR5A7O,B016AR5A7O,AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA,1468973886000,True,47

5.0,a good option,"I really like these...  the flat wires DO help them not to tangle... Has a &#34;universal&#34; tip as most things do this day and age... worked with my brand new LG G4 cell, my old rotary dial IPOD and my Kindle 8&#34; HDX.  It comes with 4 (2 sets) of extra ear cushions.  I feel that I have smallerish ears and I have a hard time finding earpods that are comfortable and will stay in.  These work great.  Comfortable and they have stayed in.  Mind you, I am NOT jogging with them in.  I only wish they'd come with a zipper case to hold them in for convenience.  At the price point, you'd think they would.  It does also have a microphone and I have &#34;tested&#34; that... worked. It has a little attachable pinch clip to keep in place as you move around. The foam tips are sort of like memory foam, but almost a bit softer really.  I think this both helps them stay in AND retain comfort.  The sound is very clean and clear - for an adult anyway.  The tips are cornflower blue if that matters to anyone... I think the pic is very clear and representative. I will update if there are any issues.<br />UPDATE: 6/29/2015 I have used these earbuds a number of times... one of the issues I have had in the past is that this &#34;shape&#34; of earbud doesn't want to stay in my ear... (tiny ears?) but these DO stay in.. I think it's the type of foam tip... seems to grip a bit better? To be fair, again, I am not jogging with them in... I am mostly in a sitting position using them. The &#34;flat&#34; wires really do help them not get all tangled... having stay that.. they also resist &#34;wrapping&#34; a bit too.  This is probably good. Otherwise you'd break the wires inside. The kiss of death to any wired accessory. Also, I've been informed that these are going to start coming with carry cases!!  Yup.  That would make them 5 star in my humble opinion and I'm keeping them in my &#34;save&#34; pile for a possible second order.<br />UPDATE 7/26/2015... Still happy with my purchase.

3.0,just ok,"I had the very first kindle...with a red leather first gen case.  I was really excited to get the new hdx 8.9&#34; kindle and a new red leather case.  These origami cases seem like a good idea.  But if you have them sitting on any kind of slightly slick surface or slightly inclined surface, it won't stand up. The function of the &#34;origami&#34; part is a little complicated, but the pictures help.  Initially it is it very stiff and hard to &#34;fold&#34;.  After a few uses it loosens up which makes setting up the &#34;standing&#34; position a little easier, but it still resists the action and as I mentioned, slips.  I was thinking a little rubber edge all around the case edge would help some.  The case &#34;attaches&#34; to the kindle via magnets and turns your kindle on automatically when you open the case, off when up close it.  On the up side, I definitely prefer the feel of the leather case as opposed to the plastic one.  Sadly neither case really functions as it should for standing. However it will provide some protection for the glass which is a pretty good size now.  In addition to the magnet set in, there is are outer power and volume buttons. They are in good locations and I have not hit them accidently. In fact those buttons are quite handy.<br />I just wish they'd put more thought into actual function and less into &#34;wow this looks cool&#34; on the stand part.<br />Hope this helps some.

4.0,"It's a READER, not really a tablet","Listen, for the price, it's good.  It's a reader, not really a tablet, but Amazon sort of marketed it to compete as a tablet.  As a reader, it's exceptional.  As a tablet it needs some work. Be prepared... there are glitches, app failures, files that cannot be loaded or used, no external volume control, once you put in in a ""cover/holder"" it is difficult to use the controls, you cannot delete files you have looked at without removing all and even though I SHOULD be able to access my paid Dishnet online account to play movies, I cannot on the fire because it will not accept a tiny video enhancement file. Further, I get a lot of ""connection error"" tabs when accessing the web or app store and more recently, it just freezes up.  The only remedy at that point is to push and hold the power button.<br />I just heard they have a new version next Spring and they are supposedly working on software upgrades for the current release. It would be nice to have a camera so that you could Skype.  On the ""up side""?  I watched a free video (provided via ""Prime"" subscription.  The video was flawless. Some ""apps"" are great and work well... about 1/2 do not.... I'm a glass 1/2 full kinda gal, so I consider this on the ""up side.""

There were days that I thought it was off and walked away, only to come back to a speaker that had been on for over 48 hours.

The fix of course is to increase the brightness setting - my guesstimate is you need to double the brightness of whatever is comfortable to you before.<br /><br />- and the result of that is, your battery life will decrease, as the screen is a major source of power consumer.<br /><br />- another minor issue i had is, the alignment of front facing camera is difficult, as it is so small and it is very easy to cover the hole --- the home button is more forgiving as it is relatively large, but not the small front facing camera holes.",[],B003YMC5RC,B003YMC5RC,AEIOIVFNO6QX7OYOJNPRKQEWMPGA,1305296184000,False,1

5.0,"Awesome TV. At $2K, it is an excellent value too.","We've had this TV a little more than 2 weeks. When the price dropped to $1997 on Amazon, I snapped it up. For the money, it is the best 4K TV out there. The smart controls work great, allowing you to use apps or browse the Internet on the TV, including side-by-side while you are watching TV. There's only a little 4k stuff out, mostly on Netflix - oceans, desserts, underwater world, etc. They are fantastic! Eventually, there will be more 4k. Haven't tried HDR yet. But, one of the reasons I got the TV was because it was one of ones that had HDR.<br /><br />I used rtings' (http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/js8500/settings) calibration settings to sharpen the picture. Rtings really likes this TV: http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/65-inch/best. It is their second best after the much pricier LG OLED. This review influenced my purchase.<br /><br />One of the main reason I got this TV was to watch movies. It is pretty much theater quality if you can sit within about 8 1/2 feet of the screen. You start to get the immersion effect when you are a little less the 9 feet away. The picture is still excellent from 10 feet, but you don't quite get the immersion effect. When the shots in the movie are bright, sunny and colorful, the view is spectacular - wow! When the shots are dark you see much more detail than I saw on my previous TV, which was a 2010 47&#34; 1080p LG. It was a good TV that I had professionally calibrated. But, it was no where near the quality of this TV: a 5-6 vs this one that's a 9-10.<br /><br />I thought about the Samsung JS9000, which is $1,000 more - pretty much just for the curved screen. Didn't think it was worth it. The LG OLED 65&#34; is better. Pretty much every review says so. But, it's priced at $4k, which is more than I wanted to spend.<br /><br />For sports, everything is really good. No judder that I've noticed. Daytime watching is plenty bright enough. Amazing picture, especially when the field is in full sunshine. I haven't watched a night football game yet.<br /><br />My wife says: &#34;It's awesome!&#34;.",[],B00U9U9GII,B00U9U9GII,AEDNNPW6JQ4H6NPMF2FYMIUZOTGQ,1449342431000,True,1

So glad I found this this leather rooCase, which I have had long enough to be convinced it was the right choice, the best case out there in my view.<br /><br />The quality is superb and the price is very fair: real leather of good quality for only $38.<br /><br />A snap connects the inner leather sleeve / glove to the folding zipper case, which acts as a base and back so you can view the Kindle in portrait or landscape on almost any surface including an uneven bed -- even when your leaning nearby on the mattress makes the case slope slightly forward.<br /><br />There's plenty of air space around the sleeve along with openings for charging, on-off, volume control, and the speakers. Because of the good airflow, it runs 2-3 degrees centigrade cooler than when flat on a surface. My Kindle was getting too hot laying on my bed and had occasional freeze problems because of the heat. No more!!<br /><br />The case itself is made of high quality leather and has two zippers so you can zip from either side.

There is one flaw that I found frustrating. I loaded 20 pictures to test the frame prior to loading/reloading the final 46 pictures. (I used a USB flash drive attached to the frame for this purpose.)<br /><br />I notice that pictures I had previously deleted were showing on the screen. The menu did not show them as being imported into the actual frame memory... Couldn't figure out what the cause was. The good news is that the Micca website had a common question section that addressed this issue and informed me that the deleted pictures were in the recycle bin located on my jump drive.<br /><br />Huh? Never heard of that one. Followed their directions to right click my desktop recycle bin and click on the USB option and delete the files/recycle option. I did this and it worked beautifully. Reloaded my pictures onto the USB flash drive and place the drive into the frame. WA-LA - no more old deleted pictures playing.<br /><br />Gave it 3 stars because - if this is a common problem... they should fix their programming. Who ever heard of a recycle bin for a USB drive being loaded onto my desktop and creating a problem??? I shouldn't have to look this up to fix it.

4.0,"Good for outdoor use, needs subscription to save video","I originally had my spotlight camera indoors, and I was not a fan. The quality of the camera was good, but the spotlight was very annoying (depending on the amount of light in your house, it can be more than a tad overzealous). After speaking with Ring, I am now using a stick-up camera, and it is working much better indoors. I would recommend going that route instead if considering this for indoor use.<br /><br />A couple of other things to note are battery life and subscription. To put it bluntly, the battery life on the spotlight camera is not good. Ring has a solar panel option that offsets this, so I would recommend getting that instead of the standard battery model. With one battery, I couldn't get more than a few weeks out of a full charge (possibly related to the aforementioned issues with an overzealous spotlight). Additionally, you do need a subscription to save any video with these cameras. They only save video to the cloud, so to get the full use of your camera you need to pay $3/month for one device, or $10/month for multiple devices.<br /><br />I will also say that Ring's customer service is very good. They made sure I had the correct device for my particular situation, and have been very accommodating.",[],B0758L64L9,B07G61MFF6,AEDWRRZADBQDUTW7HBIWH4QSMUPQ,1547167590696,False,2

1.0,"... able to see who is at your door is great, but the Ring Doorbell Pro is not great","The concept of being able to see who is at your door is great, but the Ring Doorbell Pro is not great.  When installing the product, the wire connectors would not accept and lock the wires, I had to purchase different wire connectors.  For the first three days, I kept losing power to the doorbell.  I would have to reinstall it, the wires won't stay connected tightly to the doorbell no matter how tightly the screws are.  I had to put a large amount of electrical tape to keep the screws from loosening and power being lost.<br />After that the doorbell worked as it should for approximately 3 weeks, it then started getting knocked offline and needed to be reset continually.  If it was my wi-connection it would make sense that my other gadgets would also be losing their wi-fi connection, but that wasn't the case.  3 weeks ago my video view feed was black, no audio no picture.  I reinstalled the doorbell, but it was a black screen view.  I would get the notice that someone was at the door, but I could view them.  I contacted the Ring customer service.  After several days they replied, had me run some wi-fi diagnostics and send them screen shots.  They said I needed a Ring Pro Chime, because I needed a wi-fi extender.  If it worked okay at the first, why all of a sudden would it not work now?  No response was received back customer service.  I have not received the Ring Pro Chime as I was told I would to correct the problem.  I had an electrician check my power voltage where the doorbell is installed, he said I have the correct voltage according to their instructions.  As of today my doorbell is dead, it doesn't rind, video doesn't even pull up any longer.  This is not a good product and I would not recommend it to anyone.  It has been a waste of time and money.",[],B01DM6BDA4,B07G5ZG3Q4,AH5OGXFCGV3OEA7H4NIZBQXGCOCA,1496128174000,True,3

5.0,A LOT OF POWER IN A SMALL PACKAGE,"It amazes me just how much power this little computer has.  It runs silently and generates almost no heat.  So far I have only used it with Wi-Fi and the performance has been quite good.  I want to try it with an ethernet cable, directly connected to see if performance is even better.  The biggest struggle that I had in dealing with this computer is that it has Windows 11 installed.  Not being familiar with 11, since all my other PCs have Win 10, I had a hard time finding some commonly used functions.  Of course that is not the fault of the computer.  There are some things to be aware of if you buy this.  First of all, you need a monitor, keyboard and mouse to use with the computer, since it doesn't come with these items.  Secondly, the computer seems to use all the latest connection types, such as HDMI for video.  All but one of my monitors don't have HDMI, but only DVI and/or VGA connectors.  If you don't have an HDMI connection on your monitor, you will need an adapter or adapter cable that converts the type of connector that you have to HDMI.  There is an included HDMI cable, with both ends HDMI.  There also is a mini display port connector, which I am not familiar with.  The mouse and keyboard could be another issue.  All my mice use the round PS/2 type connectors and some of my available keyboards are the same way with the old PS/2 connector.  To connect to the Geekom, you either need a USB keyboard and mouse (which will use up 2 of the 3 available USB ports) or your need a wireless keyboard and mouse.  Wireless may use one or two USB ports, depending on whether the receiver for the mouse and keyboard is integrated to handle both or if you have a keyboard and a mouse from different manufacturers, which requires two receivers, instead of one.  A good feature this computer has is a mounting bracket that allows you to mount it to the back of certain monitors, which is a space saver.  You really don't need this, as the computer is so small anyway that the footprint is minimal.  The only thing I would have liked on this is a DVI connector.  Also, the manual is very minimal.  Currently the computer goes to sleep after a few minutes and I have to press the power button to get it to wake up.  This could be normal behavior and I have an inquiry in to Geekom to find out.  I love this little computer and I will probably never buy a full sized computer again.  Storage is limited, but I keep all my data on external network drives and backed up to the cloud, so a lot of storage on the computer is not an issue these days.  If you can deal with the newer connection types with this computer, I think you will really love it.  I am really happy with it.  It is hard to find anything wrong with this computer.  I think it seems to be quite sturdy too, as the UPS delivery man just dropped the package with a big thump by my front door.  I was afraid it might damage the computer, but it worked fine, so I guess it can handle some bumps and thumps, as it was not packed with a lot of cushioning material.",[],B0BNPNXBZM,B0CBZF7ZY5,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1673059721555,False,9

Nice capacity too, as I would not buy anything less than 128GB these days, which is what this is.",[],B0B1J28W6K,B0C1SJVWTY,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1659420906829,False,0

The vertical arrangement with 3 outlets on each of the 4 sides is convenient.  The spacing on the outlets is adequate for most ""fat"" plugs.  The 4 USB ports are great too.  It is attractive looking and the power cord is sufficiently long, but not too long.  Each of the 4 sides has an on/off switch also, which is a nice feature.  The only thing they could have done better on this item is to make the plug flat, so that it could easily plug in behind a piece of furniture.

5.0,A lot to like with this power strip; does not have many shortcomings,"This has a lot of nice features.  I like the size.  It is not as large as some power strips.  The flat power plug is great, as it can easily fit behind a piece of furniture.  Two of the outlets have extra space for large plugs.  Seems like a lot of the things I need to plug in these days have the larger plugs, so for me that's almost a necessity on a power strip.  Wish they had made 3 or 4 with wider space, but it would have made the power strip larger.  The 3 USB charging ports are a good feature, something you are seeing on more and more power strips these days and it is very convenient for me.  Would have been better with one or two more, as I maxed out the 3 already.  The cord is a little on the short side, but worked okay for me.  An overall nice power strip and I like the white color too.  I replaced a larger, old, cumbersome power station with this and gained back some desk space.

4.0,Seemed a little slow,"I inserted this into a USB 3.0 port and thought it would operate a lot faster than it did.  Speed could be impacted by a lot of things, so maybe shouldn't blame the device.  I did like the fact that it is retractable, so no cap over the end to lose when not inserted.  There is not a lot you can say about a flash drive, as they either work or they don't.  The 64G size is a little small these days and I usually try to only get 128G or higher.  On the other hand, you can't have too many flash drives, as they are very convenient.  I liked the size of this, as some of the newest flash drives are almost too small.  If you don't have tons of data, this is a great backup device.",[],B0B1WCKJSQ,B0C1ZC8CFP,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1655745553072,False,0

Crank is very easy to turn.  Has a weather band.  Has SOS button that gives loud alarm and light, has on/off switch.  CONS:  Slightly heavier and bigger than some emergency radios; sound quality of AM radio is not that good, although FM sounds decent.  Does not have regular battery backup (only uses an L-Ion battery, but it can be replaced if the battery goes bad.)<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent little emergency radio with similar features to other emergency radios.",[],B09V1KS388,B09V1KS388,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1655517252704,False,1
4.0,Off-Brand; a little tricky to install,"I had a computer expert install this for me and he had a little trouble getting it working, but it does work and that's the main thing.  The only drivers available for this are on the included thumb drive which the installer was reluctant to use.  He said sometimes these off-brand items that include a thumb drive will have malware on them.  Nothing bad happened, so I guess there was nothing malicious on the thumb drive.  The company doesn't have a website, which is troubling.  If I had not received this as a no-cost evaluation unit, I might have purchased a better-known name brand.  But, as I said, the unit works and that's the most important thing.",[],B09QFZF8QC,B09QFZF8QC,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1649774591632,False,0
4.0,Confusing charge indicator,"At first, I thought I had a defective unit that would not charge.  When charging, there is a light that comes on.  That light stayed red for the entire time I was charging the unit.  I thought it should change color when charged, but the manual says the light flashes while charging and then is steady when fully charged.  That being the case, the unit probably charged much quicker than I thought.  One confusing thing is that you have to hold the switch to turn it on for about 2 seconds before the unit comes on.  Off is instant as soon as you touch the switch.  Includes charging cord and 4 different nozzle tips for a variety of tasks.  It has two different speeds, but the slower speed didn't seem like it had enough power to do much.  The higher speed seemed sufficient for most tasks but didn't seem quite as strong as you would get from a can of compressed air.  Also has a light on the front to light up your work, which is a nice feature.  Comes with a storage bag, which seemed a little small, but does hold the item and the nozzles and the charger cord.  The big advantage with this device is of course that you don't have to keep buying cans of compressed air.",[],B09N8NQG9J,B09N8NQG9J,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1649521243679,False,0
3.0,"Has nice features, but difficult to set it up","This has a number of nice features, but the manual is printed in such tiny type that it is very difficult to read.  Setting up features on the watch is a bit complicated.  I never did figure out how to set time and date directly on the watch.  There is an application that you can use to make settings and I had to load that application to my cell phone and when I started using the application, the time and day got set automatically.  I still haven't figured out some of the features of the watch, as they are not obvious.  I got it because it monitors blood pressure and heart rate.  Those functions work well so it serves my purpose.  This is my first smart watch, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I assume there may be better smart watches that are easier to figure out.  Once I learn how to fully use it, I may like it a lot better.  I just think the user interface could have been better and you shouldn't need a cell phone application to do basic time and day settings.  Perhaps you don't, but there is no obvious way to do it directly on the watch.  The free cell phone application that you have to install from the internet also doesn't seem that straightforward to use and I struggled a little with it also.  Watch is lightweight and charges up reasonably fast.  Available in several colors too.",[],B09SLMYMYM,B0C28HGT5N,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1649511804631,False,1
5.0,Very Unique with on/off switch for each port,"Unlike other hubs that I have owned, this has a nice feature.  It has on/off switches for each port.  There is a blue light to indicate that a port is on.  Not quite sure what I would need this feature for, but it is certainly unique and might be handy for something in the future.  The best part of this hub is that it is USB 3.0.  My computer has a limited number of USB 3.0 ports, so this allows me to expand one port into 6.  There is also a 7th port that appears to be just to be used as a charger port.  I do wish it has a few more ports, but that's the only thing I find lacking.  Being that this is a powered hub, it won't steal power from your system, so gives a lot of expansion capability to add USB devices.",[],B09PT94T2Y,B0BV9PZ629,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1649511122237,False,0
5.0,Nice size; accommodate most cables,"These work quite well and the opening is large enough to accommodate fairly large cables.

They served their purpose for me and you can reuse them.",[],B0019R6SO0,B0019R6SO0,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1649385132749,True,0
5.0,Lots of features,"One nice feature is that you can run this with a USB cable (included).  The other choice for running is batteries.  Works good, sounds okay.  Comes with earphones.  A good player, but has a lot of different controls, some of which I couldn't quite understand, even with the included manual.  No complaints, except it would have been nice if it had been rechargeable instead of using replaceable batteries.  They do make players that are rechargeable, so if that's what you want, pick a different player.

4.0,Works perfectly,"This is advertised as an ergonomic keyboard.  To me, ergonomic is a keyboard that is split into two slanted halves, like the Microsoft Natural Keyboard.  This is a flat keyboard.  In spite of that, the keys have a good feel and response.  I only have wired keyboards, so I got this so that I could have a wireless if I wanted to use one sometimes, as you are then not confined with a cord.  Requires 1 AA battery to operate (not included).  At first, I thought they forgot to include the wireless transmitter, but it comes hidden in the battery compartment.  This is okay, but there is no place to store it once the battery is installed.  Of course, if you are going to store the keyboard and not use it all the time, you wouldn't typically want to leave the battery in anyway.  If you want wireless, probably better to get a wireless mouse and keyboard together, as they would probably run off one transmitter, whereas with this keyboard if I want to add a wireless mouse later, it will involve using a second transmitter which would use another USB port.  The keyboard is going to be of limited use to me, as I currently use a KVM-switch that allows me to control up to 4 computers with one monitor, one mouse and one keyboard.  I would have to upgrade to a KVM switch that takes USB to use the keyboard on more than one computer.  This is truly plug and play and I had it operating in no time at all.

5.0,High quality camera with nice lighting feature,"At first, I was disappointed in this camera because it didn't come with any software, but I quickly discovered that I don't need any.  First of all, Windows 10 comes with a camera application that this works good with.  Then I did a Facebook phone call with my sister, using the camera and it performed flawlessly.  The camera can either attach to the top of a computer screen or there is a nice tripod that comes with it that works well.  Just plug the camera into a USB port and you are ready to go.  Night lighting features for darker areas.  Bright white light that can be dimmed, a yellow softer light that can also be dimmed or if there is enough light, you don't need the light feature.  Even the USB cord was nice and long, so you can position it some distance from the computer.  I have no criticism of the camera at all, but the manual is in very tiny type, so a little hard to read for my old eyes.  Also, I could not figure out how to register the warranty.  They give you a card with a QR code to do the registration, but the QR code takes you to a Facebook Messenger page with a message that says: ""Get started"" and nothing else.

5.0,Works great,"Works well and is easy to set up.  Very light and compact.  You do need a flat surface to put it on, because if you try to use it on your lap, it folds up on you.  Not sure how much I will really use it, as I am so used to an ergonomic (curved) keyboard that it is difficult to type on a flat keyboard and this is flat.  It is full sized and if you have a lot of typing to do on your phone, this will be very helpful.  Charging cord is a little short.  The bonus phone stand that is included is nice, but my phone case is too thick, so it would not fit in the stand.",[],B07KNHLHDW,B07SSDKNSL,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1629212514708,True,0
3.0,Nice Emergency Radio; AM radio reception seemed poor; FM was okay,"I got this to compare it with the upgraded Greatone emergency radio.  The two models are similar, with the main difference being that this version has fewer features.  This is somewhat more compact than the upgraded model but still has good features.  I couldn't get good reception on it from one of the strongest AM stations in my area.  FM seemed to come in much clearer.  I found one clear WB (weather band) station.  I wouldn't expect top quality sound, as the radio is quite small and compact.  As an emergency radio, this is excellent.  You can charge it with a manual crank, although it takes a LOT of cranking (no different than most radios that charge this way); a solar panel (which I haven't tried yet) or you can charge it from a USB connection. The USB cable is included for that.  If the internal lithium ION rechargeable battery should happen to become discharged before you can get it charged again, you are out of luck, until you can recharge it one of the 3 ways available.  The upgraded version has conventional battery backup, which is better.  On this version, if the rechargeable battery ever dies completely, there is a door with a screw that you can remove to access and replace the battery.  (It should last a very long time and not need replacement.)  Other features:  has an external charging port for a USB device (such as your cellphone) and a light on the end, controlled with a push button switch.  The on/off, volume knob turned easily, but the tuning knob was a little hard to turn.  If conventional battery backup is not important to you, this radio compares favorably to the upgraded version.",[],B086XH336K,B086XH336K,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1607493734311,False,0

The USB cable is included for that.  If the internal lithium ION rechargeable battery should happen to die or become discharged, there is a compartment for 3 conventional AAA batteries.  There is a switch to use either the rechargeable battery or the AAA batteries (not included).  There are two lights on this radio.  When you raise the solar panel  there is a bright light that comes on.  There is also a light on the end of the radio, controlled with a push-button switch.  Other features:  has a button to turn on an alarm; has a headphone jack, has an external charging port for a USB device (such as your cellphone).  I like this little radio a lot and there is a lot of features packed into it.  The ONLY criticism I have is that both the tuning and the volume knobs don't turn very easily; they are very hard to turn.  That's why I knocked off one star on my otherwise 5-star rating.",[],B08728SJBH,B09Y4LSD91,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1607492230051,False,0
4.0,"Hard to get unwound, but works good","Nice thin flat cable; works well.  Includes mounting clips for attaching to a wall, which is a nice bonus.  The cable comes nicely coiled, but be careful uncoiling it.  When I uncoiled it, I got a twisted up mess and it took me 15 minutes to get it straightened out.  I used it to hook my wife's computer directly to the router instead of going through wi-fi, which is slower.  Router is several rooms away, so this worked great to hook up in another room and not have to deal with the slower wi-fi connection.",[],B08CKQVNSM,B09WZZ9RDX,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1597361585112,False,1

4.0,Improvements over older versions of Tom Tom; nice large screen,"You might think that with GPS on most cell phones these days you wouldn't need a standalone GPS, but this can still be very handy for navigation and gives you extras you don't get with a cell phone.  If you are making a long trip or driving in unfamiliar places, this is what you want.  The screen is nice and large; bigger than a typical cell phone screen.  If you have an older vehicle that doesn't have a Bluetooth connection to your cell phone, this Tom Tom has a feature to link to your phone so that you can talk on your phone through the Tom Tom; it is easy to set up and works well.  There is also a ""find my car"" feature, if you forget where you parked.  I haven't tested that yet, but it could come in handy.  This unit also contains walking directions, so that if you are trying to go somewhere on foot in an area you are not familiar with, the unit will guide you.  Some of the older Tom Toms had that feature; some did not.  If you have previously owned a Tom Tom, you will find the interface slightly different, but not complicated to figure out.  If you haven't had a Tom Tom before, you might manage to learn how to use the unit quicker than someone who has owned a previous model.  One thing that always bugged me with Tom Tom (and it is still in this version); you enter addresses backwards; you put in city and state first; then street name and direction and then street number last.  It works from the broadest part of the address down to the narrowest.  There are several pluses of this GPS over just a cell phone application, but I haven't had time to check them all out, such as real time traffic reports.  Also, if you plan to drive at all in Europe, Tom Tom seems to have better maps for Europe than other GPS competitors.  I don't know if this unit comes with world maps or just U.S. maps.  As far as accuracy, the device was off by about 1/2 block on my first destination.  It said that I had reached there, but wasn't quite there yet.  It's close enough so that most of the time you should be fine and maybe some destinations are harder to pinpoint than others.  I don't think you will be disappointed at all with this unit.  There is no power cord adapter, so you have to charge it through USB or in your car with the included adapter.  The older Tom Tom units had power plugs included for various countries (about 6 different ones I think).  With USB everywhere, I guess the need for an A/C adapter is not as important as it once was.  Almost a 5-star unit, but not quite there.",[],B081J11W9W,B098BN33KP,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1581210945749,False,0

5.0,BEST KEYBOARD EVER MADE (IMHO) BUT HAS SOME SMALL ISSUES,"Have used this keyboard for many years at work and home and I wouldn't use any other keyboard.  It is that comfortable.  I would hate to pay the price they are asking for these now.  Hate to say this for those of you who want one, but I just bought one for $2.99 from Goodwill.  It is well worth it to have a spare on hand; actually have 2 spares, as obviously these are expensive to replace if you buy new. These keyboards have both USB and PS/2 type connectors and two USB ports in the back of the keyboard which I have never used.  I tried out the USB ports in the back and they do not work.  There could be a couple of reasons for this.  One might be that in order for them to function, you might have to use the USB connector for the keyboard, rather than the round PS/2 connector.  Another reason is that my keyboard does not connect directly to the computer, but goes through a KVM switch.  Through the switch, the keyboard may not receive enough power to power the USB ports.  I don't have a USB connector on my KVM switch, so I have to use the PS/2 round connector.  The only problem that I have encountered with this keyboard is the feet that elevate the back of the keyboard to a comfortable angle, tend to fall off.  I have lost a couple and cannot find replacements.  If you are used to a flat keyboard, the tilted ergo keyboard does take some getting used to, but once you have used it for a while, you will never go back to a flat keyboard again.  Microsoft has some newer versions of this keyboard, but I don't think they are an improvement and they are expensive.",[],B00002JXFH,B00002JXFH,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1569985834867,False,0

For that reason, I now usually only buy a few top brands.  I thought it was worth trying the Amazon brand disks, even if they aren't one of the brands that I normally buy.  From the looks of them, they appear to be made by a top manufacturer with acceptable quality and I fully expect them to last for a number of years.  Time will tell, but I think these are worth a try.  Note that the price is not the best price you can get.  This is only a pack of 30 and you can get a pack of 50 for about the same price with some other top brands.",[],B07N7HWP59,B07N7HWP59,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1563248178529,False,1
2.0,Couldn't get it to connect to my router for wireless control.,"This is a good price for a starter kit of 5 devices.  The program you install on your Smartphone is easy to install and looks like it works as intended.  Here's the problem I encountered.  Every time I tried to connect to my router I would get the message ""Only supported on 2.4 GHZ Wifi Networks"".  My router is dual band and I believe it broadcasts WiFi both in 2.4 and 5 GHZ.  Apparently these devices are not seeing the 2.4 GHZ and are looking at 5 GHZ and aren't able to connect or the Smartphone is connecting at 5Ghz and the device won't pair with the phone unless it is connected via 2.4Ghz.  I contacted support and they gave me this answer:  ""You will need to connect your mobile device to the 2.4Ghz Wifi for the app to connect to the devices when they are in the pairing modes. If you are unsure how to connect to the 2.4Ghz of the dual band router, you may need to log into the router to either turn on the 2.4Ghz WiFi or rename it so you know which connection is the 2.4Ghz. If you are unsure how to do so, you will need to contact your router manufacturer for assistance. Alternatively you can pair the devices via AP mode as indicated in the manuals of the devices.""  I don't know how to make the necessary changes in my router to be able pair the smartphone with the 2.4Ghz connection and I didn't want to take the time to learn how and potentially mess up my router and/or the way the Smartphone connects to my router. (It seems like I would need to change both.)  I tried the AP Mode that support mentioned, but it still would not connect; it would fail every time.  The whole setup seems just too complicated.  Also, they fail to tell you that at least on the water sensor, you have to twist open the device and remove the paper tab that prevents the battery from making contact, before you can set it up.  Am disappointed and surprised that no other reviewers had the 2.4 vs. 5 Ghz issue.  Not recommended unless you know all about how to set up your smartphone and router to connect at 2.4Ghz or unless they already are.",[],B07LFQ74C1,B07P374Y47,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1561936400338,False,0
4.0,A little confusing to set up; good quality picture,"Due to the poor English in the manual, I was a little confused about setting this up.  At first I thought I could connect it to my computer and do the setup, but it doesn't work from a computer.  Apparently you connect to the computer just to download videos it has taken.  I finally figured out that you have to connect it to your vehicle to set time and date and format the internal storage (which it tells you to do before first use).  The battery charge lasts only seconds after being unplugged from your computer or your car, so there is not time enough to make any settings with it unplugged.  Getting into the menus that you need to make initial settings was a bit confusing, but I finally got it figured out.  The suction cup worked okay for me; other reviewers have complained about it.  Maybe it will fall off after a while, but so far, so good.  The picture quality is good and it has a nice wide viewing angle.  I haven't tried downloading any of the video yet, but I'm sure it is not difficult.  Good camera that would be better with clearer instructions.  There were some strange looking small pieces included in plastic bag and I don't know what they are for; no explanation that I could find and no obvious use.

4.0,WORKS WELL; CONFIGURABLE,"This is the first switch that I have owned that can be configured.  That's a big plus.  Once you determine the IP address of the switch, you simply enter it in your browser, enter the default password (which you can change) and you are into the setup program that is internal to the switch.  You can do individual settings for each of the 8 ports, if you know what the settings mean (I didn't.)  This is an optional thing; you can use the switch without any configuration; just plug it in and it is ready to go.  There are two reasons why I didn't give this a 5 star rating.  1) The indicator lights showing active ports are on the same side as the cables.  Since I want cables to go out the back, I can't see the lights with the switch facing me.  My prior switch had lights on one side and cables went out the other.  In all honesty, I can't say that the lights ever provided much benefit and could be distracting, so this might be an advantage to some people to have both lights and cables on the back.  What's the point of the lights if you can't see them, unless you want the cables facing you?  2) In order to register the switch and get a program to determine the IP address of the switch (so that you can configure it), you have to use a mobile device (a smart phone) and install the Netgear Insight application and set up a Netgear account.  Strange that you need to use a device other than a computer to do this and it is rather a nuisance.  Apparently there is no Windows version of Netgear Insight.  You have to use your IOS or Android device.  Another problem I had is that you supposedly can change your password on your device, which I tried, but apparently the password did not meet the requirements, but was never informed of that by the program.  I was able to change the password on the device after getting into it via the IP address.  Netgear makes good products and I have purchased other Netgear products in the past with good results.  This is another quality product, so if the placement of the lights doesn't bother you, I would recommend it, especially if you need individually configurable ports.",[],B01MYTIPG2,B0932GQP4B,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1553308059153,False,3
5.0,Fast; comes in a nice case,"This is an impressive little drive and operates quite fast on USB 3.  No install or drivers needed as it is ready to use; just plug in the provided USB cable and it is ready to go.  It might be a little pricey, but not much more expensive than typical USB sticks of the same capacity (256 MB).  It doesn't seem to provide you much more value than a regular USB stick, at least not in terms of storage space.  The value is in the speed.  It is quite heavy compared to a USB stick and about 2 to 3 times larger, as it is encased in metal, so probably far more durable than some storage devices.  The size is still small, at 4 inches long, 1 3/4 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick.  It also comes in an attractive metal storage case that would be great for transporting it.  This would be an ideal external drive for your data.  You can then detach it and move it to another computer easily, just by unplugging the USB cable.  If you are traveling, it should travel quite safely in the metal storage box it comes in.  The capacity is a little low by today's standards, but larger solid state drives do get expensive.  This would be ideal in a 1 TB or larger size and I think we will see bigger solid states drives in the future at affordable prices.  I would not hesitate to recommend this if 256MB space is large enough for your needs.

3.0,"Disappointing, but it does work (kind of)","The first time I plugged in the Wi-Fi adapter, the TV froze.  I tried it again with the TV turned off and then it worked fine at power up and paired perfectly.  I had great hopes for this device and it seems to work fine if you have a QWERTY keyboard displayed on the screen or an actual input area for you to type in.  In some places it simply doesn't work, such as YouTube.  The search screen for YouTube does not display a keyboard, but the letters in alpha order and you have to move around and select letters instead of just being able to type in your selection.  My wife uses the TV a lot and watches almost everything from YouTube, so this isn't going to provide much of a benefit over the remote that came with the TV.  There is nothing really wrong with the keyboard; it is just that various services provided on the TV just haven't standardized on one way to do alphanumeric input and on searches.  Some of the services just aren't responsive to typing from the keyboard, which is too bad.  The keyboard is a great idea and may work for you; just be aware of the limitations and that you probably can't type in your search strings in all places on your Smart TV.",[],B07CM5NZRC,B07CM5NZRC,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1551570200185,False,2
3.0,Seems to work some of the time,"Honestly I haven't had any calls that I would identify as scam calls since I installed this.  The problem is that I haven't been home a lot, so calls may be coming in and I am just not here to get them.  Of course I still get plenty of sales calls from somewhat legitimate companies from numbers that obviously aren't stored in the machine already.  When you receive a call, there is a BLOCK NOW button you can press to block the call in the future.  Unfortunately it only works about half the time.  Can't say that I have ever gotten ""#2"" from any of my phones to work, which is supposed to also block calls, as well as pushing the BLOCK NOW button.  The price is probably not worth it for a device that only partly solves the problem.  There are probably less expensive ways to deal with unwanted calls, although I don't have a good solution, which is why I got this device.  Granted my phone system is set up a little strange, so that could be part of the problem with this working as well as it could.  Also, the device needs a way to be updated to add more scam numbers as they are identified.  Seems to me that in a few years there could be many more numbers that aren't already stored in the unit.  The unit is a great idea, but it needs some work.  Probably works best with just one or two telephones, but I have phones all over the house; some are corded and some are cordless.  I have great hopes for the next model of this device if they make some good improvements.  Can't quite recommend it yet, unless you have an extreme problem with unwanted calls.  It probably will cut down on the unwanted calls, so might be worth it to get it, even if it helps only a little.",[],B07GPNQNWG,B0B696YT88,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1548476400382,False,2
5.0,Long Enough for Most Uses; Not Bulky; Works Good,"I like to keep a variety of lengths of Ethernet Cables, as I never know when I might want to relocate something.  Unfortunately most long cables tend to take up a lot of space.  This flat cable is much more compact.  The flat design makes it nice to place up against a wall and there are included mounting clips for a wall or baseboard, that have a small nail that you just hammer in.  I don't know what the maximum length limit is for Ethernet.  I suspect that after a certain length, speed might be impacted, but I didn't see any degradation in speed or performance with this over 65 foot long cable.  I am very satisfied with this and while I don't quite yet need a cable this long, I may some day.  If you don't need the full length, it is very easy to coil up a portion of the cable; easier than round cables.

4.0,Easy to get working; don't forget it needs power to work,"I got two outdoor security cameras of different brands at the same time.  The other brand I could not get to work and setting it up was complicated and could apparently only be done through a cell phone.  This camera, on the other hand, could be set up with a computer and the setup was easy and I had it working within minutes, for a live feed.  The picture quality is good and I tested in the dark and still got a great picture.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I couldn't get it to record (supposedly it has some built-in memory, although you can also add a memory card for more memory).  For ease of setup and for the live feed, I give it 5 stars.  I'll try to work with it some more and if I get all the features working, will update this review.  Important note:  I got this without giving thought to the fact that I didn't have a good place to mount it outside.  Also, it needs an outlet to be plugged into, as do most security cameras.  I have outside outlets, but nothing up near the roof where I would want to mount this.  The power cord is not long enough to go for a very great distance, so might require an extension cord to run it.  An exposed extension to a security camera is not very secure, as all anyone would need to do is unplug it to disable the camera.  I thought perhaps I could just keep it inside and aim it out of a window.  Unfortunately my windows sills are two narrow for the camera to sit and shoot out of a window.  I didn't find a good way yet to mount in front of a windows.  Of course my lack of planning is no fault of the camera.  The camera seems rugged and well built.  It appears to be able to use 5Ghz Wi-Fi; the other camera I tested did not.  There is one slight design flaw; the aerial is very close to the mounting bracket, so it is difficult to position it properly.",[],B07D3RV1XX,B07Z7MRNDZ,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1544589055047,False,2
5.0,"For over burn, requires disks that don't seem to be available from normal retailers","In order to try the over burn feature, I would need the appropriate disks that can normally hold 8.5 GB (DVD+R).  These disks are not too difficult to find online, but the office supply stores only seem to stock 4.7 GB disks.  I guess you either have to special order or buy online.  Most everything that I need to burn can either fit on a 4.7 GB DVD or can be compressed (without much loss of quality) to fit.  It may be false economy to buy the higher capacity disks, as they are nearly double the price of lower capacity.  With burnable media prices being so low anyway, you don't gain much by squeezing as much as you can on a particular disk.  So why did I get this drive?  I like to have a drive on the shelf if one goes bad (and they do sometimes), and then I don't have to wait for one to arrive.  I assumed it was probably good to have one that can burn to maximum capacity as this isn't much more expensive than a regular DVD burner.  Since I haven't actually installed or used the drive yet (waiting for disks), one should not pay as much attention to my review as some other reviewers.  I just wanted people to be aware that you can't insert a 4.7 GB disk and expect to over burn to 8.7 GB.  You need to understand the differences in available media and get the appropriate blank media. Update:  I finally received the appropriate media to test the drive.  It seemed to work good for the first 6 or 8 disks, but then 3 disks in a row had burn errors.  Bad media?  I don't think so; it appears the drive is failing already.  I'll test on another computer and see if it is the media or the drive and update the review again, but right now I can't recommend this drive at all.  UPDATE 2:  I tried this again after rebooting my computer and it now seems to work fine and does indeed overburn, so you can squeeze a lot on one disk.  When I had 3 bad burns in a row, I thought it was the burner, but it may have been bad media.  On the other hand, I suspect something flaky on my PC, as I have had bad burns before occasionally (not recently) and then after a reboot everything was fine again.  I may have too many programs loaded when I try to burn.  That's not the fault of the DVD drive.  Most likely the fault of the burning program (and I am using a major well-know program.)",[],B071WNBMQ2,B071WNBMQ2,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1542505073306,False,1
5.0,Does a better job than cheaper antennas,"Previously I had purchased a cheaper antenna that was not powered, as this one is.  It worked pretty well and got quite a few channels.  This one, however, works better and a few more channels come in clearly and consistently.  I tried it too without the USB power and it still works well, but without the power, not all the channels came in.  For the little extra that this costs over cheaper antennas, it is worth it.  The long cord on it is a wonderful plus, as you can position it quite a distance from the TV, unlike cheaper antennas that may have shorter cords.  The only thing I can see wrong with this is that since it is powered, it does use some electricity, whereas cheaper antennas don't.  Probably not really much electricity, but as we add more and more devices to our homes, those energy vampires can add up.  I suggest trying it with and without the power.  If you don't use the TV every day, unplug the power.  If you have pets that tend to chew things, watch out for them with the long cords on this.  Very satisfied with it and may get another one for other televisions in the house, once we cut off cable, which we are doing soon.  You recover your cost of the device with just one month of cable.

4.0,"Adequate, functional, a little large, no lights to show functioning ports","Pretty much a plug and play device; 1 minute to install.  There is supposed to be a configuration program that you can access, but I wasn't able to do so with the IP address given in the instructions.  It wasn't necessary anyway, as the device functions just fine on a simple network without any additional configuration.  There are two things I didn't like about it compared to my old switch, that I was replacing.  First of all, it is a bit larger than my old switch at 8 1/2 inches long compared to my old one that is only 6 1/2 inches.  Also, the power supply is considerably larger at 6 inches long and 3 inches wide and 1 inch thick.  My old switch uses only a large plug that is 1 3/4 x 1 3/4 x 1 1/4.  The second thing I didn't like is that there are no indicator lights to show the functioning ports.  My old switch has lights for each port that is working, which is nice.  You may prefer not to have any lights and if so, this Linksys switch may be to your liking.  Note: there is a disc included with documentation, but I didn't find it to be of any particular use.  On the plus side, this does appear to be a quality, heavy duty switch, so might be well suited for a commercial application (such as in an unattended area, like a computer room in a large business).  It appears to weigh nearly twice what my old switch did, so it is solid.  I have used Linksys products before and found them to be good quality with no issues.  You can buy a cheaper switch that is smaller and does essentially the same thing at a considerably lower price, but you most likely won't get the same quality as you would with this switch.  Also this switch does apparently have a POE (power over internet) feature and if you need that, you also might want to get this.  I don't see a need for POE in my configuration.  Possibly overkill for typical home office, but if you want a good quality switch, it might be worth the extra cost (or not).",[],B07GN4FVYW,B07HXW73SH,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1541786971667,False,0
5.0,Excellent sound quality; easy to operate; AM radio does not work in U.S.,"This was much heavier and larger than I expected.  It would be nice if it had a carrying handle on top, but since it runs on house current and not batteries, it's not portable, so the handle would only be useful for moving it.  The weight is probably because of the high quality built-in speakers.  The sound quality is excellent, compared to even good quality computer speakers.  It also sounds better than my stereo speakers.  The manual leaves a little to be desired, but the system is pretty easy to operate and most operations are intuitive.  The biggest disappointment I had is that the AM radio does not work; it is apparently set up for European standards and won't work in the U.S. from what I was able to find out. It is disclosed in the description that AM is not available in the U.S.  It does get FM stations with good fidelity and has an FM aerial.  There is an external input on the back, so you can play through the unit, which you might want to do because of the good sound quality.  They also include a connecting cable for this, which is a nice bonus.  Unfortunately no external output, which could be handy, but not a necessity.  Just insert a CD and it starts playing the CD right away.  Insert a USB stick and it starts playing any audio files on the stick.  At first I thought there was no slot for a USB stick, as it is not identified that way in the manual; it is identified as a phone charging port, a U disk port (maybe they meant USB) and for I-Pod reading.  This is just a one-CD at a time system; would be great if it could take multiple CDs.  The remote is okay and has all the functions you'll need, but is a little confusing at first.  I didn't test the Bluetooth connection capability to a cell phone, as I don't think I would use that function.  If you want a really nice sounding CD player than also handles other audio files on a USB or SD card that also has FM radio and you don't care about the AM radio not working, this is worth getting.  Would give this 5 stars if the AM radio worked.

5.0,They Seem to Improve Speed; very thin; don't kink up,"I hooked these up right away and they did seem to help with speed of my local area network.  They are very thin, but sturdy so they don't kink up easily, as some cables will.  I like them and might get some more for other connections in my network.  Unfortunately the cables are a little short and I just barely got one of them to reach.  If I get any more, I'll have to see if they make a 10 or 12 foot version.  Other than length, the only other downside I can see is that these are somewhat pricey.  You get what you pay for, so they may be well worth it.",[],B07H5F2SSX,B07H5F2SSX,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1539065145888,False,0
5.0,"Compact, Reliable","Previously I was using another make of a 10-port hub and it worked okay, but it did not support USB 3.1, as this does.  Also, it had a very distracting strip of blue light showing that it was powered on.  This one has a tiny ""pilot"" light by each USB outlet, that lights up when that port is active.  I like that much better, as you can tell which ports are active.  Also everything plugs in vertically; my other hub had only 2 vertical ports and the remainder came out of 2 sides.  The side ports did make the cables a little neater, as they laid flat, whereas with this hub they stick straight up and don't look quite as nice.  The hub is compact, better than the older bulkier one that I was using.  You can never have too many USB ports and I am already using 8 of the 10 available, even though my computer is equipped with several also.  Just about every device these days is USB or wireless.  Nothing to do for set-up.  Just plug it in and use it.  Of course being a powered hub, you do need an available electrical outlet, which could be a downside, but it does ensure you are going to have the power you need to drive your USB devices.",[],B076YN6CSG,B076YN6CSG,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1534958058643,False,0
5.0,Easy to Use; Work Very Well,"These sleeves really work and they are big enough to comfortably accommodate at least 4 to 6 thick cables; maybe more thin cables.  At first I thought 20 inches (the length of the sleeves) seemed a little short, but since cables start and terminate at different points, anything longer might not work as the run distance would be too long and you might have to &#34;backtrack&#34; on a cable after it comes out the end.  I have masses of cables running everywhere and just one of these helped make things neater.  Now I need to use the other 3 in the package.  I might even buy a second package of 4 if I still have cables that need straightening up.  The nicest feature of these sleeves is that you don't have to feed the cables through them.  They unzip for the entire length and you just lay the cables into the sleeve and zip it up.  No need to disconnect cables.  This is a genius idea and I love it.  I have tried other methods to keep cables together, such as zip ties, but they don't work nearly as well as these.",[],B0756CZPR6,B077HNPLHZ,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1520051027898,False,1
5.0,"Compact, Fast, good for foresable future","I replaced a large bulky router/modem combo from my ISP with this modem, as I already had a good router and didn't need two routers.  My ISP was charging roughly $10 a month for their equipment, which I will save now.  Of course the SB8200 is a little bit pricey, so it will take me about one and half years to recover my cost.  I was surprised how small this modem is; very compact and easy to find space for.  It generates a little heat, but has vent holes all over the outside and top for good ventilation.  Most of heat come out the top, but obviously you don't want to block any of the openings and make sure there is plenty of space above it.  I am getting great speed from the modem and had no issues with it at all.  My ISP was able to set it up remotely in about 30 minutes.  All the &#34;experts&#34; say it is best to have your own equipment, rather than rent from an ISP.  I like that idea, but the only problem is that if equipment fails, you are responsible for it, whereas if you rent from the ISP, they replace any defective equipment at no cost.  Also if you need an equipment upgrade, the ISP covers that too.  I don't expect to need an upgrade as this will handle the fastest speeds being offered now by my ISP (1 Gbps), although not yet in my area.  Right now I have 300 Mbps and the modem handles it nicely without any problem.  This modem does NOT use the Puma chipset, which was causing some issues.  This is a great<br />piece of equipment and suitable for home or business.  Just has 4 lights (power on, upload, download and connected to internet).  I thought I had seen comments about the lights being dim, but they are nice and bright; maybe bright enough to almost be distracting at times.  Am very happy so far with the modem and would buy one again if it lasts well over time.  There are a couple other modems by other quality manufacturers that are somewhat comparable to this one, but in side by side comparisons this seems to rate a little better.  The Arris brand was recommended to me and it is the brand used by my ISP.",[],B01N6SKK1G,B0BJGKZKV9,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1516488756708,True,3
5.0,Great Picture; Lots of available adjustments; low blue light emissions; auto adjustment to light levels,"Maybe it is just because I haven't upgraded my monitor in a long time and maybe it is because this is the biggest monitor I have ever had on a computer, but I love this monitor.  Since I spend a lot of time on the computer, this has a feature that is very important to me, which is low blue light emissions.  The blue light that comes from monitors is not good for our eyes, so a monitor that claims to reduce that is a good thing, if it really works.  I don't know how to tell for sure, but after using the monitor for several days, it does seem that I suffer less eye fatigue.  The monitor also has a &#34;bright intelligence&#34; button that automatically dims or brightens the screen depending on light levels, which helps reduce eye fatigue.  This feature can be turned on or off to your preference.  There a number of different light adjustments on the monitor and they are not difficult to select, once you figure out the buttons to set them.  There are 5 adjustment buttons, but none are assigned to a specific function, but there is a way to assign some of the buttons, so they are configurable to some extent.  Initially, you press any one of the buttons to bring up a five selection menu on screen that allows you to adjust brightness, depending on what you are doing (web surfing, multimedia, office or reading) as well contrast and sharpness.  There are various other display adjustments for positioning the screen (which I had to use, since the screen was initially slightly off center at the highest resolution).  Also there are adjustments buttons for sound, if you use the built-in speakers and for auto shutoff time (choice of OFF, 10, 20 and 30 minutes).  There are various other settings.  I don't quite understand all the settings, but there is an included manual on the CD that comes with the monitor and the manual seems very complete, is well written and easy to understand.  My monitor also included an HDMI cable.  I tried using HDMI, but couldn't see much difference in that and the older type of connector (which they call D-Sub, also known as VGA, which is an analog connection vs. digital).  If you are watching Blu-Ray movies, HDMI should give you a better picture.  I don't have any Blu-Ray movies, nor a DVD drive that supports Blu-Ray, so no need for HDMI.  Also, I use a KVM switch to control several computers and that doesn't support HDMI connectors.  The included CD also has any drivers you might need, but the monitor worked perfectly on Windows 10 without the need to install any drivers.  The HDMI connection did bring sound to the built-in speakers, as well as the picture, but the sound volume was extremely low, even at 100%.  When I used the other connector (D-Sub), and a separate audio cable, the sound volume was much better.  Maybe something I am setting incorrectly?  Also, typical of speakers built-in to a monitor, the sound quality is very poor.  If you listen to music much at all, you will want to stick with external speakers.  This is probably typical of all monitors with built-in speakers.  It was disappointing, but not unexpected.  The monitor is very lightweight, so it is very easy to move.  Has a nice low profile base.  Can be tipped to a desirable viewing angle, but no height adjustment.  There is a lot to this monitor and to take full advantage of it, I will need to read the manual to understand all the available settings.  Requires a 2 step assembly of the base, but it is very easy; you should be up and running in mere minutes.  This can be wall mounted, but requires a separate wall mount kit, which is not included.  Overall, a great monitor that should meet the needs of just about anyone.  With a 3-year warranty, you can't go wrong.",[],B07659Z1QM,B07659Z1QM,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1515416590502,False,1
3.0,"Good Resolution, Wide Range, Easy Setup, Very Slow Response","There is no operating or setup manual with this camera; only a website listed in a very thin brochure.  You go to the website to set up the camera and download a manual, if you need one.  Setup is pretty easy.  I set it up on my computer and then later on my Android smartphone using the free app from Google Play Store.  5 stars for the easy setup procedure once you realize you need to go to the website.  The camera started functioning right away on both the computer and the phone.  The picture resolution was quite good and it does have a decent wide angle.  I didn't test the face recognition feature, as it didn't seem like it would be useful to me.  The main problem I encountered with the camera is the delay between the time the action occurs and the video result; it takes almost 5 seconds for the video to appear.  That's a real problem if you need live action; it's not quite live with the 5 second delay.  The Android phone version was very easy to set up and use.  It could be a nice camera if they can do something about the slow response time.  Also they need to put a little more information into the printed brochure that comes with the camera.

4.0,Excellent WI-FI coverage; setup can be tricky; support may be questionable,"For performance, I would rate this a solid 5-stars.  I bought a quality $300 router before this one and it just wouldn't fully cover the house with adequate wi-fi strength.  I spent $100 more on an extender, which finally helped somewhat, but still not ideal.  The router in this D-Link system has good strong wi-fi signal by itself, but it includes an extender which make it even better.  Excellent wi-fi coverage and also works good for wired connections as well.  For the price, the D-Link router is well worth the money.  So why not 5 stars in my rating?  The setup instructions turned out to be useless for me, but may have been because my internet was coming in through a router/modem combo; multiple routers on a network can cause issues and change how you might access a given router to set it up.  Support is important, especially when you are trying to set up for the first time, but I tried to call and there was a 25 minute wait, so decided to e-mail instead.  That was several days ago and the e-mail has not been answered yet, so I am disappointed in support, so that's one reason I knocked one star off my rating.  I strongly recommend you download the manual from their website, as the unit doesn't come with it.  The manual seems to be well written and comprehensive.  It still didn't help me with setup; I had to figure that out on my own.  If you have a straight-forward setup that is not complicated, you may not have any issues with setting up this unit.  Since this and most routers I have seen only have connections for 4 wired items, I am running an &#34;extension&#34; switch for more network devices and computer.  I could not get it to work at first, until a network expert told me that you have to reboot the router after you connect the switch, in order for it to be recognized.",[],B0711TPWZY,B084BXS6NL,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1504133000443,False,2

What I especially like about this one is the length.  It is nearly 10 feet long (3 meters), so what you are plugging in can be some distance from your computer.  I also liked the fact that the cable is wrapped in braided nylon, so it seems very durable so it doesn't seem like it will kink up or easily wear out.  It claims fast changing capability, but I am not sure that it charged my smartphone any faster than any other cable.  The only downside that I can see at all is that this cable is rather pricey.  The price is somewhat justified by the length and quality of the cable.

3.0,Missing needed SD Card; no cord for attachment to computer; poorly written manual; doesn't appear to ever completely charge up,"When I got this, I assumed it was a complete operable unit, but apparently you have to buy an SD card to go with it, which I did not know.  You would think they would include the card, since the unit is useless without it.  I was able to buy a card for around $8 on sale, but they usually are not that cheap.  The unit has a nice bright, clear display screen, so the optics seem to be quite good.  Also it comes with a nice long cord to use in your vehicle, so if your accessory adapter is not near this, the cord will most likely reach.  The included manual is very poorly organized and is not written in the best English.  Also, certain icons that show on the screen are not even explained in the manual.  It seems as if the manual is out-of-date with updates that may have occurred in the device software.  I could not find a newer manual on the website; in fact could not find any information on the website about this device.  For some reason, the indicator that the device is charging never seemed to indicate that charging was complete, even when I left it plugged in overnight on my computer.  As soon as I unplug it from the car or the computer, it will no longer function, so maybe I got one with a defective battery?  They also do not include the USB cord for hooking the device to your computer.  There are several types of USB cables and the end that goes into the camera is small, so you need that specific size.  Fortunately I had a spare that fit.  Somewhat disappointed in this device so far and even though I charge it for hours, it won't come on unless it is attached to the computer or the car (with the car on). The setup menus are easy to use and not difficult to figure out, although the manual is not that helpful. I might actually use it out the back window of the car, since I had rather record what is going on behind me than in front.  Luckily my van has an accessory outlet in the back, as well as the front.  Meanwhile I just want people to realize you don't get a complete package when you buy this.  You have to buy an SD card and if you want to save any video it makes, you need a USB cord that fits it.  Note that the unit can also function as a digital camera too, but I was unable get it to work without being attached to the computer or the car, since the battery never seems to charge up.  It has been several days since I contacted the company with a question about the charging and no response in several days.  I noticed that if your unit has a problem, on the website it says they charge a $40 handling charge for you to send it in and get it repaired or replaced.

5.0,"Great value for the price; works flawlessly on PCs, with only a couple of minor issues","This is a review for the TK-408 switch.  I noticed the reviews seem to show up on several different models.  This model has the round PS/2 type connections for mouse and keyboard, and female connections for VGA. It also has audio connections, so you can use one set of speakers for several different computers. There are no USB connections on it.  All the cables are included.  I use this to switch between PCs; some reviewers mentioned trouble with MACs.  The only real issue I have encountered is that if I power up a computer that is off and I am currently switched to another computer, when I go back to the one that was off (that is now on), the screen resolution has dropped.  If I switch to the turned off computer while it still off and power up and boot up before switching away, there is no issue and then I can switch back and forth all day with everything staying as it should be.  It's just a very minor annoyance.  If the computers you are switching between are always on, it would never be an issue.  The other thing that I found out is that for me the audio was not of much use.  The reason is that I am often listening to music on one computer; when I wanted to switch to another computer to do some work, the sound stopped, obviously because now I was on another computer that didn't have music playing.  I ended up just hooking up 3 sets of speakers for my 3 computers.  A lot of space used up, but a better solution for me.  The sound situation is not a problem with the switch, as it was doing exactly what it should by looking for output from the line out on the computer that you are switched to.  Some reviewers mentioned problems with delay in the hotkey switching.  I haven't noticed this and usually it takes no more than one second to switch.  My switch uses ScrLk twice followed by the port number the computer is on.  I have tried out two more expensive switches that don't have hotkey capability and you have to press a button on the switch.  With Trendnet switches, you can do either - use the keyboard sequence or press the physical key on the switch.  I have had this switch in service for a number of years and the only physical issue I have encountered is that once in a while the master keyboard and mouse connections loosen up and have to be re-seated.  The switch has given me many years of flawless operation and so far has proven to perform better than much more expensive switches.  Very good value for the price and I highly recommend it.  I like Trendnet equipment so far and have some other products of theirs that also work very well.",[],B000HI7OZ4,B07SVBV9TM,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1483999400000,False,0
2.0,"Solid, well made, but some non-standard connectors and apparently no hotkey switching","I was going to wait until I actually had truly tested and used this before I wrote a review.  I got this free as a review unit.  The problem is that I can't use it without spending some money for cables, as it does not come with cables.  StarTech says that's on purpose since people have different cable needs, especially different lengths. The cables that StarTech has available for it are over $21 each, which comes up to well over $60 for my 3 computers, almost the price of the switch.  With 4 computers connected, the price would be even more.  Okay, so they don't provide cables, but for the price of the switch, maybe they should at least give you a coupon or a voucher for one or two cables or a discount on the cables.  Interestingly the 2-port version does include cables; the 4-port does not.  StarTech's cables are nice, as they combine the needed USB with the VGA cable; otherwise you have to run two completely separate cables (one VGA cable for monitor and a USB cable for keyboard and mouse).  If you have USB cables as most people do, you can easily purchase the needed VGA cables inexpensively.  This brings me to the first real issue I have with this switch.  The master monitor connection is a female connector, which is standard.  Unfortunately the 4 computer monitor connectors are all male connections, so you can't use a standard male to male VGA cable that you would normally use from a computer to a monitor.  You have to get male to female VGA cables (which are typically called extension cables).  Why they would use this non-standard method of connecting monitors is puzzling.  A couple of reviewers were also concerned that this switch does not come with a power supply.  That's usually not a big deal as I found out that a power supply is not necessary, as the switch gets it's power from the USB connections.  There is no explanation as to why it has a place to plug in a power supply, although in some cases if you have a lot of USB devices connected to your PC, you might need additional power that a power supply would provide, so I assume it is for supplemental power.  It's good that they provide a way to add additional power, if you need it, even if not the actual power supply.  The next issue I encountered was trying to determine whether or not you could switch between computers with a hotkey sequence on your keyboard or whether you actually had to reach over to the switch and press the button for the computer you wanted.  Apparently there is no keyboard switching or if there is, no one seems to know what keys are used.  I read the manual for the setup and was concerned that it states that for PC to get the switch to work properly, a couple of BIOS settings for PC need to be changed.  I am not even sure that my computers have those particular settings, especially my older computers that sometimes have more limited BIOS settings available.  I have had 3 other KVM switches and none of them needed a change to BIOS settings.  Given the problems that others have had with this switch in that it doesn't always work flawlessly, I am not sure that I want to take time to test it right, since I already have a nicely working KVM switch.  I still have to buy cables.  On the plus side, this switch appears to be well built with a metal case; not cheap plastic.  It appears to be nice and solid and just heavy enough.  If the issues I mentioned are not a deal-breaker for you, I think this is worth trying.  I will update my review and add or subtract stars once I have a chance to test this in actual operation.",[],B00006B8DA,B07S9H9QVN,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1483997797000,False,0
4.0,"WORKS GREAT FOR CABLED CONNECTIONS; PASS THROUGH OUTLET NICE, BUT NEEDS SLIGHT REDESIGN","Other reviewers will probably cover the wi-fi setup, but I got this for another reason.  I hate wi-fi because it can be slow, too many things can interfere with the signal (such as microwaves) and there is always a security concern.  In addition to being a wi-fi extender, this works great for extending the range of your router's wired connections, which is how I am using it.  There are two parts to this; one is the sending end, which you plug into your router via included ethernet cable and then into an electrical outlet.  The receiving end of this has 3 ethernet ports and you can connect up to 3 devices by ethernet cable.  If you use it this way, there is no setup at all.  It truly is plug and play and worked immediately for me.  The setup sheet doesn't make it clear that it can function this way, but there is a picture on the box showing it.  Also, I was very pleased with the fact that both pieces included a pass-through outlet, which is a great feature.  It would seem that this would keep you from losing an outlet.  Maybe and maybe not.  Here's why.  Both pieces are quite long.  If you plug them into the top outlet of a typical 2 part outlet, the devices will cover the second outlet.  So just plug them into the bottom outlet, right?; then the top outlet is free.  Maybe.  The problem is that the devices are just a little too tall and you cannot fit a 3-prong gounded plug above them.  You can use a 2-pronged plug and it will mostly likely fit.  You would think someone would have tested this when they designed the product.  It's that slight design flaw that caused me to knock one star off my rating.  Other extenders of this type that I have seen are small enough to fit with another 3-prong cord above them when plugged in to the bottom of a 2-part outlet.<br /><br />If you have a large house, it is possible you might have more than one main electrical circuit running through your house.  This only works if you plug both devices into the same master circuit.  Of course that is not the fault of the device; that will be true of any range extender of this type.<br /><br />These power plug range extenders have been on the market for a while, but nice someone finally decided to include a pass-through outlet, but too bad that the device isn't just a little smaller so that it doesn't partially block the second plug in a 2-plug outlet when plugged in at the bottom.  Note these do need to be plugged directly into a wall outlet; can't be used off a power strip.  That could be an issue if you are short of outlets, as I am.<br /><br />The connection speed wasn't quite as good as I expected, but it is adequate.  The units heated up a little, which I didn't like, but not uncomfortable to the touch. I also have experience with standalone extenders that don't use the powerlines in your home; they work just about as well and some of them also have ethernet ports; the only difference being that you are going Wi-Fi to the extender and then going back to ethernet if you want to use a cable, whereas with a powerline extender, you are going through wires all the way.  Those standalone extenders only require one outlet too.<br /><br />I have used other TP-Link products and generally they seem to be of good quality, so I don't hesitate in any way to use their brand.

3.0,Long Term Life is Questionable; Seagate not good quality drives now,"The first one of these I got was DOA, but Seagate replaced it quickly for me at no charge, other than my cost to ship it back to them.  Seagate gives a 2-year warranty on their products and from what I understand that's because the expected life of their drives is only two years.  I have had too many failures with Seagate drives, although a drive from any manufacturer can fail and I have had other manufacturer's drives fail too.  I think my inclination now is not to buy Seagate any more.  There are better brands out there, but the bargain priced drives in any brand are usually the cheaper, less reliable ones.  You get what you pay for.  Just be aware that anything you put on a drive from ANY manufacturer should be regularly backed up in another location.

4.0,Well Built Switch; Only HDMI video input; Convenient hook up to computer via standard USB,"This is a very expensive KVM switch that is really overkill for an individual, due to the price and the feature of being able to use authentication devices including common access cards (or CAC cards) for access.  CAC cards seem to be a government only system used to securely access computers.  If you are not a government entity, the CAC capability in the switch is a waste, although supposedly there is support for other types of authentication such as fingerprint recognition.  Unfortunately no documentation is provided on how to connect and use authentication devices; there is a USB port for an authentication device for each computer.  No doubt because of the capability of being able to use an authentication device, the switch is more expensive, larger and heavier than a typical KVM switch. Note that CAC or other authentication devices is optional with the switch.  The switch appears to be very solidly built and should last a long time; not flimsy in any way like some cheaper switches can be.  It has big well lighted push buttons for the up to 4 computers that you can attach.  What I didn't like is that there apparently is no software switching between computers; you have to use the manual push buttons.  (On the switch I was using I just press scroll lock twice and the computer number of 1,2,3 or 4.)  What I truly do like about this switch is the fact that keyboard and mouse are controlled from a single USB cable that plugs into the switch and into your computer.  I could not fathom this at first, as the KVM switches that I am used to have a 3-way cable that plugs into the mouse port, keyboard port and monitor and then into the switch with a 15-pin connector.  I didn't realize that a single USB cable could handle both keyboard and mouse, but this switch is designed to do that.  You just plug one end of a regular USB cable into the switch and the other into a USB port on the computer (has to be a built-in one, by the way; not on a USB hub or extender).  You don't even need the keyboard and mouse ports on your computer.  One thing I wasn't thrilled about is that the only monitor input to the switch is HDMI.  The cables you may need to connect each computer's video output and your master console monitor will vary depending on what kinds of outputs you have available.  For a KVM this expensive, it would seem that they could have included the older standard video connection (the 15-pin) that was the usual way to connect for many years until newer connectors such as HDMI and DVI came along.  In any case, the switch comes with no cables, so you have to buy your own.  I ended up needing 3 different kinds due to age of the various computers and the monitor and the types of video output(s) they had.  I called support over my confusion on the cables and they call you back the next day; no immediate support I guess, unless you are on a paid plan.  Didn't feel I got a good answer from support and was still confused about the cables until I actually connected it and started using it. To be fair, this may not have really been the fault of support, but my fault for not understanding how to ask my questions correctly.  The biggest problem with this switch is that the documentation is woefully lacking.  There should be some explanation about how this differs from a regular KVM switch and what kinds of cables you might need.  This is a fine product, but is hurt by so little documentation and lack of explanations of how to connect it.  Also, note this is a powered switch, so you do need a outlet to run it.  If you want a top of the line KVM switch, this is it, but it's far from perfect.  Not for novices.",[],B01BNDK2BY,B076ZTM2X5,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1470460230000,False,1
5.0,IMPRESSIVE - VERY NICE,"Never thought I would want an all-in-one computer because you can't expand it at all, but with USB you don't really need to, as you can add external USB drives or devices (printers, scanners, etc.) easily or even use USB flash drives.  Of course you can't add memory, but this comes with 8 gig, which is really all you need these days, unless you are a gamer.  This has a nice large display screen with a clear picture.  Will be great for watching video.  Has a built in microphone and video camera.  Tried the microphone with Windows 10 assistant Cortana and it works great (even though it warned me that it might not).  Comes with Windows 10 pre-installed.  All you have to do is customize a few local settings (time zone, language, etc.) and you are ready to go.  Because everything is built in to the screen, setup time is very fast.  You plug it in and turn it on.  You do have to put batteries in the wireless mouse and keyboard, but they are included, as was the USB stick needed for the wireless devices.  Was up and running in no time.  The wireless mouse and keyboard is nice, but the keyboard is a flat keyboard and I much prefer an ergo keyboard, so I probably won't use the keyboard.  My biggest problem in the past with wireless devices is that they go through batteries fast.  This keyboard and mouse have on/off switches, so you aren't using up the battery when you aren't using the computer.  With everything built into one unit, you might think it would be pretty heavy.  It is heavy, but most people could move it without difficulty.  There is a lot to like about this system and not much to dislike.  I was disappointed that it didn't have more USB ports.  There were only 2 on the back and 2 on the side.  One of the 4 is used for a tiny USB stick that is used for wireless communication with the keyboard and mouse.  You'll quickly run out of USB ports, so you may need a USB hub, if you have more than a couple of devices to hook up.  The 500 gig hard drive is a little small by today's standards, but should be big enough for most people.  For lots of data storage an external source is really more ideal than saving on the C: drive.  You might be able to get a little more computer for less money, but it seems to me that the pricing is not that bad, considering what you get.  Also includes McAfee internet security and some cloud storage (although small and you have to do things to increase it or pay for more space).  Overall not a bad value and ideal for limited space.  No cords and wires to deal with.  You have only the power cord to deal with.  I was also impressed that it included an optical drive.  Many newer systems (especially laptops) don't include a DVD drives anymore.  Performance seemed a little slow, but nothing significant.  I think most people will be happy with this system and it will meet the needs of all but the most demanding users.",[],B01DSSLEHI,B01DSSLEHI,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1469338965000,False,1
5.0,"Very Compact, Downward Compatible, Quiet and Attractive, Light and Easy to transport","I wasn't sure this would work for me, as it is listed as a USB 3 device; however it worked perfectly with my USB 2 ports, so it is downward compatible.  It's nice when a product is truly plug and play, which this is.  I plugged it in and it was immediately available.  I copy nearly 300 gig of data to it.  It took a while at USB 2 speeds, but it worked flawlessly.  I also played a movie from it and it worked perfectly I tested this on Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 10.  On XP it is recognized by Windows, but thinks that it isn't formatted (which it is).  Probably would not work properly on XP.  In Windows 7, the driver for it automatically installed in just seconds.  On Windows 10, I didn't have to do anything; it was immediately recognized.  SSD (solid state) is the only way to go these days and I think that in a very short time the mechanical hard drives with spinning platters will be a thing of the past.  Of course being solid state, it is completely silent and it produces almost no heat at all.  It is not unlike a USB stick, except that it has a short cord that it needs to plug in.  The cord is a bit short (around 16 inches), which is my only gripe with this product.  Being that it is advertised as portable, you wouldn't want to carry around a long cord with it anyway, so that could be an advantage.  The unit is very small; about the size of 2 USB sticks.  I acquired an SSD drive of the same capacity (500 GB) a couple years back and it is twice the physical size of this unit.  Technological advances have steadily decreased the sizes of storage while increasing the capacity.  This has 3 included files for enabling security on the device (one for Windows and one for MAC).  The third file is for Android devices and it is just a text file with a link where you can apparently get what you need.  Great little device.  I would not hesitate to get another one; although I would go for a terabyte model next time.",[],B01AVF6UQQ,B01BCWKBZI,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1459010954000,False,1
3.0,Okay as an amp; only one type of input; serious range limitation on remote control,"This is a decent power amplifier.  I had an old large amp powering the external speakers from my television and that died.  This small amp fits much better in the spot where the big amp was, which was sitting on end to fit in available space.  The Lepy is small enough to fit just about anywhere.  A few problems with the Lepy.  First of all, there is only one input jack, which is the single plug 3.5 mm size.  Fortunately I had the proper audio cord, but regular RCA input jacks would be nice.  There are RCA output jacks for two speakers, as well as the &#34;pinch&#34; type speaker connectors.  With my old amp when I muted the TV, it also muted the amp.  Not sure how this worked, but muting the TV now does not mute the output to the Lepy.  Possibly because I had to use a different output jack from the TV, which may not mute external output.  The Lepy doesn't seem to work with the other output jacks that my old amp was plugged into.  You can mute or adjust the volume on the LEPY with the knobs or with a remote, but I don't want to get up and walk across the room to adjust the knobs.  The problem with the remote is that it appears to only have about a 10 foot range.  We want to control it from about a 12-15 foot distance, which just is not possible.  The remote doesn't seem to work past about 9 to 10 feet.  Possibly the battery on it is low, but since it was brand new, I doubt that.  The final problem is that there is really no instructions with the box, so you really have to play with it and guess what the various buttons do.  Also, what happens when you plug in an SD card or USB stick?  Does it automatically search for and play audio files?  There is no instructions on using those inputs.  The box does have a built-in FM radio, but I couldn't figure out how to easily tune it; it appears to be just up and down to find a station.  I wouldn't want to use it as an FM radio, as it appears that it is not able to get anything but the strongest stations.  An AM tuner would have been nice too.",[],B00L8O8WK2,B00L8O8WK2,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1443562668000,True,1

I believe there are better DVDs that are archive quality, but you pay a lot more for them.",[],B009NXOKOM,B009NXOKOM,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1428548460000,True,0
1.0,Not able to get it working,"What a great idea.  This is what amounts to a portable internet connection that doesn't rely on someone else's wi-fi, that may not be secure.  Great for travelers.  First you have to activate the device, which was very easy and took almost no time.  Then you have to set up a connection to the device from your computer.  Also very easy.  Now for the downside.  I just kept getting an alert that said the device was not connected to the network and gave me a button to connect.  I would press the button and nothing happened.  I couldn't get it to connect to the AT&T network.  I live in a major metro area, so I'm sure there has to be coverage here.  In fact I don't know how the device was able to be activated if it didn't see the network, as activation is through the internet.  I called tech support and they said that it might be because my wireless router was interfering with it.  I switched off my router and still could not connect to the AT&T network.  I also wondered if my wi-fi router interfered with it, wouldn't others also interfere with it?  The tech support person said no, because I wouldn't be that close to them.  Makes no sense to me.  Seems like any signal that could be picked up strongly enough to detect would then interfere.  I don't have the time to mess with this any more, so am giving up for the time being.  Another thing that I did not like is that it appears that the device is always on.  The screen blanks out automatically after a few seconds, which is good.  It also has an on/off switch, but even though the switch appears to function, it seems like it just turns the display on and off, but the device continues to eat up the battery life.  I don't think the battery will last as long as they claim.  I had the device charged up 100% last night and it still seemed to be charged 100% this morning, but in trying to use it today, it has already dropped to 90% and that's probably from only a few minutes of use.  If I ever get this working, I'll update the review.  At the moment I really don't feel that this is ready for prime time.  My technical knowledge is better than average, so this device could be a real challenge for someone to set up, if they can get it working at all.",[],B00HCNHH2W,B00HCNHH2W,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1398632084000,False,4

1.0,Troublesome - Updating Old Review,"Initially I had problems setting up the printer to use wirelessly.  It was taking so long that something seemed wrong, so tried to cancel.  The cancel went on for hours, so had to reboot.  After reboot, the setup for wireless was done in 5 minutes, so probably was just a problem with my system rather than with the printer.  Seems like a decent printer with reasonable speed and reasonable color print quality.  It's not photo print quality, but more than adequate quality for most color printing needs.  Comes with 4 color cartridges so you can replace just one color when that color runs out.  Some color printers used to come with only 2 (black & color).  When any one color ran out you had to buy a new color cartridge.  Most manufacturers have moved away from that and this is a good thing.<br /><br />Note that you can also use a USB connection if you don't want to use wireless.  This is not a huge hulking printer, so fits nicely in small places and with the wireless capability you can put it in a location somewhat away from the computer.  HP seems to make quality products and I am confident that you can't go wrong buying this printer.<br /><br />My initial reactions were above, but we had a lot of trouble with ink cartridges on this printer.  Hardly any printing and the cartridges were empty or the printer thought they were.  Replaced all the cartridges and it worked.  Then tried to print again a few weeks later and it is saying that two of the cartridges are empty.  They can't be this soon with only having printed a few pages.  Got the cartridges straightened out and now it says there is no paper in the printer, but there is.  I tried loading and reloading paper multiple times, but no luck.  This is a very troublesome printer and I think it is going to go into the junk pile now.  Too bad, as HP makes some things very well (or used to).  I have an HP scanner I have had for years and have had about 4 HP laptops, which were built very ruggedly.  Their older laptops were built like tanks and they last and last.  I guess you can't make everything well.  I am doing with HP color printers for now, unless the quality improves.",[],B0076O2A4C,B0076O2A4C,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1382915690000,False,1
5.0,Very Small; Plug and Play,"The capacity of thumb drives keeps going up and the sizes keep going down.  They are so convenient for off-site backup.  This is probably about as small as is practical.  I think it is about the smallest flash drive I have seen.  About the size of a stick of Dentine gum.  This is not particularly high capacity by today's standards, but 8 GB is not that small either.  It's good for transporting a number of small files or a few larger ones or a backup of data if you don't have too much data.  Great for a key chain too, as it has a nice big loop on the end.  After I inserted it on a Windows 7 PC, it was up and ready to use in seconds.  On XP it wanted to reboot after it had been inserted, but I tried it without rebooting and it appeared to work fine.  Two minor issues with this drive.  It doesn't have a conventional USB plug.  Instead it looks like a little 3-contact connector.  At first I wondered how I would insert it into my USB port.  Believe me it does go in, but one problem I had was which direction to insert it.  It fits into one side of a USB connection in either direction.  In one direction it works of course and one it doesn't.  The other problem is that the connection hides under a little bendable rubber piece and my USB ports are recessed, so I couldn't bend the rubber enough to easily insert it.  If you want a very tiny storage unit that works great, this is for you.  I have always had excellent results with any Verbatim products too and I full trust their quality and reliability.",[],B007LLYB1U,B00BXK7LBC,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1340839440000,False,1
4.0,"Compact Attractive, Quiet Unit","Several reviewers mentioned the difficulty in setting this up.  It really wasn't that bad.  The steps were pretty easy, at least on my system.  The biggest issue I had was notifying my firewall that the software that was needed to map a drive for the unit was okay to run.  There is no mention of firewall interference in the small quick install manual, but the Seagate on-line help is excellent and I was able to find the answer quickly.  It was a bit confusing on how to identify the unit to the firewall, but I finally did get it set up.  There were 3 pre-built folders on the unit: Download, Public and Wiki.  I haven't yet figured out what Download and Wiki are for (or been able to access them), but the one called ""Public"" seems to contain most of the storage space and I was copying files to the unit in no time at all.  The unit doesn't seem very fast, but that could in part be the speed of my network.  You can use it with USB as an extension drive to one PC, rather than on a network, if you wish.<br /><br />The fact that the install disk was a DVD threw me for a bit.  I had expected a CD, but some vendors now use DVDs instead of CDs for install programs.<br /><br />I was a little annoyed that I had to go through a complete registration process before the software install would proceed.  When I went to a second PC and the registration process started again, I was more annoyed, but did discover that you can cancel out of the registration.  It wasn't that obvious the first time through, so I guess they really want you to register.<br /><br />You do need to know that by default the drive is configured for Raid-1 (mirroring), which means that you only have 2 terabytes of space; not 4.  The second drive is used to mirror the first.  You can switch it to Raid-0 and get the whole 4 terabytes, but then there is no redundancy, so if either drive fails you are out of luck and you lose all your data.  With Raid-1, theoretically you can replace the failing drive (if only one fails at a time) and the system will rebuild the data.  I haven't yet discovered how to change the drive setting from Raid-1 to Raid-0.<br /><br />This is a very compact, quiet unit.  It's totally black except for blue lights on the front that show power, status and drive activity.<br /><br />I did not try the included backup program, as I prefer to use my own backup procedures.<br /><br />Only time will tell if the unit stands up well or not.  Seagate used to make the very best drives, but other companies surpassed them, at least for a time.<br /><br />This is a nice unit for the price and I'm happy to have it.",[],B002HKEQZ6,B002OB4DC4,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1306211962000,False,1
1.0,Watch Out for their Terms of Service,"The device worked well for me, but after 4 months, they shut off my Magicjack for violation of terms of service.  It took a bit of effort to find out what was violated and they claimed excessive use.  There is no support number; you have to get support online only with live chat or from their knowledge base.  There is a billing questions number and you can call that.  That's the only way to get a live person, but they only want you to call it for billing questions.<br /><br />The problem is you have no idea what constitutes excessive use or when you might be exceeding their limits.  The terms of service says if your usage exceeds 20 times more than the average customer or more than 50 calls a day you have violated the terms.  The 50 calls is easy to quantify, but what about the 20 times more than the average?  The terms also say it is not limited to just this criteria, so you have no clue what other criteria they might use to decide that you have had excessive use.  There is no way to know what that is.  Instead of just suspending your service for a while, they cut you off permanently with no recourse.  You lose any remaining time you may have paid for.<br /><br />If you are a light phone user, MagicJack may be okay for you, but don't expect to be on the phone for a lot of time or they may cut you off for excessive use, with no recourse, since you must agree to the terms of service.  I would never get this device again.  Read those terms of service before you agree to use this device.",[],B0014FWBBQ,B0014FWBBQ,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1287616516000,False,8
5.0,Only Brand I Have Used That Have Not Had Any Failures,"I have burned almost 1,000 DVDs and every brand I have tried has had some failures in a spindle of 100.  With one brand, I had as many as 18 that failed out of 100.  I am on my second spindle of 100 Sony DVD-R reprintables and not a single one has failed so far. (Actually one did, but it was my fault.)  Out of all the brands I have used, they seem the best.  I only use 3 brands now: Sony, HP or Verbatim.  I would buy Sony again anytime.  Note that every brand I have tried fails if I go above the minimum burn speed.  Could be my old slow hardware that causes the problem with not being able to burn at higher speeds.  I have also experienced playback problems with certain brands.  They appear to burn okay, but then have problems playing back.

3.0,Very Compact & Light,"I just started using my camera yesterday and my first impression is that this thing seems very fragile.  Hope I don't drop it, as it might not survive the fall.  It is extremely small, light and compact.  Think of two packs of cigarettes or two packs of playing cards.  It is that small.  Great for travel due to the light weight and compactness.  Got it for about $90 on sale; would hate to pay more than that for it. Very easy to operate, but if you have big hands, this will be too small for you.  Be warned that it won't take more than a couple minutes of video without a memory card, so you'll have to put a little more money into it if you really want to do video or really much of anything.  The first video I took came out pretty decent, but it was in good light.  I tried some still shots inside at night and they came out very dark in spite of the flash.  The flash doesn't seem adequate, so this is probably a camera best used outdoors or in the daytime.  Great camera for a kid.  This is a good camera for small hands and a great size for kids.  If they break it or lose it, you aren't out a bundle.  As another reviewer pointed out, it does only take video in the ASF format; not MPEG, as the advertising suggests.  I think MPEG might be just music files.  I didn't need to install the software to capture the pictures or movies on my computer (Windows XP).  Another great thing is that this is a complete package.  It has the camera, a carrying strap, a carrying case, USB cable, TV cables, headphones, battery, battery charger and software.  It does not come with a lens cap and the cap is not available either.  You can buy an optional tripod for it and with the small size, I think that could be useful in some situations to help hold and stabilize the camera.  I am not sure how you store music on it; I probably won't use that feature, but it seems like it would be a nice compact music player; again you'll need a memory card to save much of anything on it.  One problem I had so far.  The memory card (which you have to buy separately--a standard SD card) slips in the bottom under a little rubber membrane.  The first time I held the camera I accidentally popped out the card and lost the shots I was trying to take.  This might be a problem and I am thinking I may have to put a piece of heavy tape over the bottom to hold the membrane and memory chip in place and prevent ejecting the memory again.  Another downside that I see is the battery.  You can't just pick up some spare batteries at the corner store and pop them in.  You have to use the special rechargeable battery.  If you don't have a spare one charged up, your camera will go dead and you'll have to wait until you can plug in the charger and recharge the battery.  That's another $20 for a spare battery.  My digital camera uses standard AA batteries, so I can use either rechargeables or regular batteries.  If this camera used regular batteries, it would make it larger and heavier, so the small rechargeable does help on the weight and size.  Don't buy this if you are a serious photographer.  Buy it for occasional use, for easy portability and as a first camera to learn on.  Controls are easy and straightforward.  Nice camera for the money, but not for serious photographers.  It does a lot for a tiny little thing; sure doesn't make me want to go back to the days of huge video cameras that you had to hold on your shoulder, due to the weight.  Minaturization can go too far and this is about as small as I would ever want to go; might be easier to use if it was just a tiny bit bigger.",[],B0006G332A,B0006G332A,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1146166949000,False,15

5.0,Amazing Keyboard Cover,"This is the best keyboard I have found for the iPad, and I've used a lot of them. In terms of the usability and comfort of the keyboard itself, the quality is simply unmatched. My last keyboard had flimsy keys and would sometimes type 2 or 3 letters with one keystroke, while other keys didn't seem to work at all. This one is exactly the opposite - it feels great to type on even if it's a little undersized, and all the keys are exactly where you'd expect them to be. Having two shift keys is also quite nice, that's one of my main gripes with every other iPad keyboard.<br /><br />The cover feature is also very good, though the hinge magnet does seem a little bit less ""snappy"" than the smart cover. It works fine, but it just seems a little bit lower quality. When closed, it blends perfectly with the iPad itself and creates a seamless brushed metal case all the way around, aside from the two ends of the slot that the iPad fits into during use. It is slightly thicker than the iPad 2. One thing this product has over many other keyboard covers is that you can use portrait mode, though as stated in other reviews, that position is not quite as steady as the magnet in the holding slot does not work in portrait orientation.<br /><br />The battery life is also quite impressive. The manual claims 6 months (2 hrs/day usage) on a single charge. I can attest to that since I've had it for several months and have yet to charge it a second time (although I use it probably an hour a day, if that).<br /><br />The last point is the price. Having used it, I'm confident it's a good buy. Might be a bit on the expensive side, but you're getting your money's worth - it does not seem rinky-dink like a lot of these other keyboards. This is clearly a professional, high-quality product.<br /><br />For me it's turned typing on the iPad from a headache/nightmare into, basically, using a normal keyboard. I've seen a couple other reviews that complained about the protective edges getting in the way, but I keep my wrists up when I type so it's not a problem for me. The only thing I miss from a normal keyboard is a delete button (the 'delete' on this keyboard is backspace) and the home/end keys. There may be a way to do those, but I haven't used it long enough to find out.<br /><br />I'm a software developer with roughly 10 years of solid typing experience, and this is not just a great iPad keyboard, but in itself a very nice keyboard, period. I wouldn't mind having to use it on a normal computer. Overall, it's simply amazing. I typed this entire review with it and had no problems whatsoever.

4.0,Great picture but not using an Otter box case.,"Well this is a long review because it took 2 of us to figure how to attach the monacle to my cell phone! There are no instructions about attaching anything anywhere. It comes with a paper sheet that tells you how to clean the lens, cover the lenses when not using etc. Then it shows the 4 parts of it..nothing else about how to use it with the phone. I finally saw what looked like another lens cap but with a hole in the center..this piece was not in any picture. Turns out you have to put that on the front of the monacle to attach to the the bracket that also attaches to the phone...and if you have an Otter box cover on your phone, it doesnt fit in the bracket. After taking my phone out of its protective case, we were able to finally get them all together. The picture I took with this set up was zoomed all the way and came out very nice and clear and the color was great and natural. The target was about 50 feet. Then I took the same picture with just my phone and it came out much darker and got blurry as you zoom in closer. So for that I gave it 4 stars. But Im not going to take the case off my phone every time I want to use it. It does have an adjustable spring grabber on the holder but it doesnt stretch wide enough for my Otter box to fit in it.",[],B07F6Y9N43,B07F6Y9N43,AFFZVSTUS3U2ZD22A2NPZSKOCPGQ,1581453665685,False,0

5.0,FIVE WELL DESERVED STARS...,"As a long time Kindle Fire user I was happy to see the new HD8. I waited until the price was unbelievable before purchasing because I didn't want to be disappointed. I loved the old Kindle Fire, the body, the features, all of it. I was extremely disappointed when Amazon did away with the indestructible design of the old Fire. My HD6 has been thrown, tossed, dropped more times than I can count (in a subway station, on concrete, on asphalt) and it just shuts itself off until you're ready to respect it. Turn it on and pick up right where you left off. I've had it for two years and I never planned on giving it up..until now.<br />I wanted the HD8 because I am a reader and being limited to how many books I can have at my fingertips is hurtful. I have over 3K books in the cloud and selfishly I wanted to keep about 1,000 on hand. New book, favorites, classics. Not having expandable memory affected that. With the HD8, I now have the capability to have my requisite 1000 books on hand at all times.<br />As a lover of all Amazon,  I have a Fire TV. Last weekend my very sweet teenage children lost the remote and I was too in awe of their skill to search for it. I downloaded the app on my HD8 and it connected in under a minute. I know this app was always around, I've seen it but...on the tablet it's amazing. I have a blank screen and I just swipe using my finger to my hearts content.<br />Now to the technical stuff that I don't always get...the screen is crisp, very bright. The size is perfect and that was my initial concern. I didn't want a huge tablet but when I use the case I prop it on my tummy when I'm laying on the couch reading and it's perfect. Text to Speech is the best thing ever as of this minute. My books read to me...no need to pull up Audible as well!<br />I haven't seen any other major changes and I've been using a Fire HD for years, but I am in love with this one.<br />This will sound strange but my advice is get a case for it. Amazon sellers have a wide variety of cases and with the delicate feel of this tablet I am still a little wary of dropping it. Also, being able to prop it up makes it great for using it in the kitchen for your cookbooks, reading while laying down or watching movies in the bathroom (bubble bath-highly recommended).<br />As with my other Fire I take this one now with me EVERYWHERE I go. When I leave the house I grab cellphone, car keys and Kindle everytime. I highly recommend.",[],B018SZT3BK,B018SZT3BK,AFO3G62P2JXCNMWZTAIB56KPG56A,1482242986000,True,3

5.0,Excellent quality bag...,"Purchased for my daughter who is now into 'retro'  bands for school. The size is good. You can easily fit a smaller laptop or tablet, along with a few notebooks and a pencil case. It really is pretty roomy an long. The strap isn't adjustable but on a 5' 4&#34; girl it sits on her hip in the right area. No flap, only a button closure but I don't foresee that being an issue with everyday use. The screen print is very good...I'll wait to see how long it lasts but as of now it looks pretty good.<br />Also, very good seller. Responds quickly. Extremely understanding and very fast turnaround when a problem arose. Would buy from again.",[],B00XQAKHMW,B00XQAKHMW,AFO3G62P2JXCNMWZTAIB56KPG56A,1469993231000,True,0
4.0,"Rugged, durable, but runs hot","This is a lifesaver for backing up my SD card on the go (I normally shoot with two 128GB cards); I love that the design is rugged and durable (if on the heavy side). Setup took only seconds. Only potential downside is that the unit runs very hot when left on for prolonged periods...and if you're copying over a significant number of files, that's likely to happen, so I would leave it in the open / a well-ventilated space rather than stashed in your camera bag. Otherwise another great tool for serious photographers!",[],B07BMHSL19,B07BMHSL19,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1539290531602,False,0
5.0,Fantastic tool for the serious photographer!,"I started shooting with my first DLSR and lenses about two years ago; one of the major inconveniences was lugging around a heavy shoulder bag containing my DSLR body, lenses, batteries and accessories, so I was thrilled at the prospect of a rolling camera bag. Usually when I travel, I'm lugging around a small wheeled overnight bag plus a bulky camera bag and tripod, but with the Convertible Rolling Camera Bag, I'm able to combine my camera and lenses and overnight bag into a single bag. The clever Velcro interior can be rearranged in any number of configurations; there is room for two camera bodies and numerous lenses, along with a built-in laptop pouch, memory cards, and ample side pockets. It also comes with a rain cover. You can use the bag as a roller bag (preferable) or as a backpack. The wheels handle smoothly and the collapsible handle is sturdy; I feel like this bag will stand up to a lot of abuse and still perform well. I look forward to stepping up my photography game (and saving my back!) with this great new addition from AmazonBasics!",[],B01G7QDWB4,B01G7QDWB4,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1484649203000,False,2
5.0,"Sleek, stylish, and incredible sound!","My first Bluetooth speaker was the Bose Soundlink; I then transitioned to a smaller, more portable Braven LUX. As an audiophile, when I was offered the opportunity to test drive the RIVA Turbo X, I jumped at it. The first thing I noticed right off the bat is the WEIGHT; the speaker clocks in at nearly 6 pounds (compared to the lightweight Braven, or the slightly heftier Soundlink). It's also designed like a sportscar, with a glossy black finish with red rubber accents covering access ports. The top contains streamlined buttons for Power, Surround, Bluetooth pairing, mute, up and down volume, and Turbo mode. There's also an iOS app that allows you to control the surround and turbo settings directly from your phone.<br /><br />I appreciated the quick start guide handily attached to the top of the speaker; it recommends that you play the speaker at 50% volume for several hours to break them in. It comes out of the box partially charged (around 40%) meaning you can start using it immediately (which I did using David Garret's new &#34;Explosive&#34; album). The sound balance is fantastic; as I live in an apartment, unfortunately I'm not able to really take advantage of the Turbo mode (which boosts to over 100dB). Pairing was a snap and I was off and running. As soon as I synched with my iPad, I was prompted to download the &#34;Ground Control&#34; app (which as previously mentioned, gives you battery life stats, volume, and the ability to turn on surround and Turbo modes).<br /><br />It also comes loaded with extras in the form of RCA cables, male-to-male audio cables, and it's also capable of charging other devices. The battery is recharged via AC (the life is around 26 hours); no USB option here. The touch buttons on top illuminate when you hold your hand over it, which is a fantastic feature in a dark room or if you're using this outside.<br /><br />The sound is fantastic with just about every genre I threw at it, from Baroque opera vocals to instrumentals to EDM.<br /><br />This is a serious investment that not only looks fantastic, but sounds absolutely fantastic...and my Bose Soundlink is going in the closet. If you're looking for maximum power with no trade in sound quality (especially at higher volume levels), the Riva TurboX is the way to go.",[],B00IPSC6F6,B00IPSC6F6,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1469996738000,False,1
5.0,Great keyboard for extended writing / typing.,"I had previously been using an [[ASIN:B00GH0N1LM New Trent Airbender Mini 1.0 - Clamshell Wireless Bluetooth iPad Mini Keyboard case. Compatible: 1st & 2nd Gen iPad Mini (polycarbonate, matte case)]] for a travel keyboard, but with a cramped layout, it wasn't conducive for typing for extended periods on my iPad Mini, so when I was offered the Kensington Wired iPad Keyboard, I jumped at the chance.<br /><br />No setup is required other than plugging the lightning connector into the iPad.<br /><br />The full-size keyboard is responsive (no sticking / dead keys) and perfect for composing e-mails or documents on the go. It feels like a regular full-size keyboard and is sturdy (unlike other travel / portable keyboards I've tried). The only downside for those intending to use this with an iPad Mini is that you will need a separate stand for your iPad, but as a writer I really appreciate the feel and responsiveness of this versus smaller travel keyboard cases.",[],B00M1C82VY,B00M1C82VY,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1419855404000,False,1
4.0,Amazing sound with a few small drawbacks,"I've had several sets of Bose Companion speakers over the years, but this was my first experience with a Bose Bluetooth product. Setup was quick and easy, and as you can use the speaker as the battery is charging for the first time (plugged in), I had my speaker powered up and connected within five minutes of unpacking. You can pair the SoundLink III with up to six devices and it will automatically connect to the last known device. With a 30-foot range, you can be several rooms away and still get crystal-clear sound.<br /><br />The sound quality is fantastic...good bass for a speaker this size. You can also REALLY crank up the volume on this one; sound is still full and balanced at max volume. I love that the unit is portable and holds a charge for quite a while (up to 14 hours; the battery lasts up to two years). Because the battery is not user-replaceable, I tend to keep it plugged in when I am using it for long periods.<br /><br />The one downside is the fact that there is no remote; it would be nice to at least be able to adjust the volume remotely rather than walking over to my phone and using the volume buttons, or walking over to the speaker and using the buttons on top, which are covered with a rubberized layer, but this is a small issue overall.",[],B00HWSXVDG,B00OPVJ0JW,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1396140474000,False,3
4.0,JBL Balboa Sub10 is a worthy contender,"Although the JBL Balboa Sub10 delivers very good performance for a relatively modest price, I would never refer to it as ""the little subwoofer that could.""  That's because it's far from little; this thing is quite big by my standards.  However, considering that the function of a subwoofer is to reproduce low-pitched audio frequencies, I'll accept that fact that it's the size it needs to be do its job well.<br /><br />Because I live in a multi-family building and have neighbors with which I share walls, I have not been able to crank up the volume beyond medium.  That being said, I have been quite pleased with the bass sound and have not experienced any distortion with this subwoofer at the volume range that I have used.  Audiophiles who do not have cost as an object will no doubt want a more expensive subwoofer than the Sub10.  However, for the rest of us who are just looking for a dependable, reasonably priced subwoofer for our sound systems, the JBL Balboa Sub10 is a worthy contender.",[],B000O8WE66,B000O8WE66,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1300485088000,False,0
5.0,An amazing e-Book reader with numerous extras.,"I received a Kindle 2 as a gift recently. I'd had my eye on the Kindle since its launch, but couldn't justify the high price tag. I use several forms of portable technology including an HTC touchscreen smartphone, but the Kindle 2 was my first eBook reader. Opening the Kindle 2 was an experience: Amazon has cleverly packaged the Kindle in minimally wasteful packaging; the box itself is very clever and space-saving, and the USB cord is tucked into the two-prong adapter (so if, like me, you initially think that they forgot to include the USB cable, just pop the prong adapter off the end).<br /><br />First, the size: the Kindle 2 measures about 8 inches by 5 inches by .36 (it's literally thinner than a Number 2 pencil), so it's about the same size as a paperback without the thickness (or the weight). It weighs only 10.2 ounces, so it's easy to slide it into a large purse or backpack. The display is large and crystal clear, but is only in black and white, so if you're getting magazine or newspaper subscriptions, be aware. There are sixteen shades of grey, though, so photos and illustrations have a lot of depth and contrast despite being in black and white. There are six different text sizes available if you have problems with too-small fonts, but the Kindle screen isn't backlit, so this won't work in low light without a reading light. There's also the controversial text-to-speech feature, which is the same technology that's come with Windows OS for years; a synthesized voice (male or female) will ""read"" the text out loud (there's a 3.5mm headphone jack if you want to listen in private). After the Authors' Guilld threatened to sue Amazon.com over the feature, publishers have the right to disable it on Kindle versions, so be aware that the text-to-speech feature may not work on all Kindle books.<br /><br />You can purchase and download Kindle books instantly using the Kindle 2's free Whispernet (an EVDO modem with fallback to 1xRTT that uses's Sprint's 3G network). Most New York Times Bestsellers are available in Kindle editions, which are typically $9.99. There are no Kindle rentals; once you've downloaded the book, it's yours. However, there are numerous free Kindle books to be found on Amazon.com and elsewhere; simply click on the Kindle Books tab at Amazon.com and set to sort by price ($0.00 titles show up first). Many of the free Kindle texts are based on older (think 19th-century) authors and are transcribed by volunteers, so they may not be exactly what you were expecting. You can either purchase Kindle books from your PC and have them sent wirelessly to your Kindle, or you can browse and purchase directly from the Kindle, but be careful: Kindle books are purchased via 1-click, which means that you could accidentally purchase something you'd only intended to look at. The download time depends on the size of the book; for a text-only book, it took less than a minute to download. When  I downloaded a larger book with illustrations, it took several minutes.<br /><br />Reading on the Kindle is much like reading a paperback; the Kindle ""disappears"" as you read. However, the page turning is a bit jarring, since every time you turn a page, the screen flashes in contrast (at first I thought that it was some sort of flaw or bug). The previous page button is on the left edge, while there's a next page button on both sides of the Kindle, so page turning is easy (other than the screen flashing). On the downside, you can't flip several pages ahead easily without repeatedly clicking the ""next"" button. With a real paperback, you'd simply thumb through the pages.<br /><br />There is no expandable memory slot, but the Kindle 2 features 2GB (1.4 GB for user content) of internal memory that will hold up to 1,500 books as well as documents (PDF, HTML, DOC, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversion) and MP3 music and AAX Audible audiobook files. You can even set up customized MP3 music playlists (it's under ""experimental"") by dragging files into the ""Music"" folder on the Kindle by hooking it up to your PC via the included USB 2.0 cable. If you have documents that are in another format (the Kindle native format is .AZW), you have two choices for conversion: either e-mail the documents to your Kindle e-mail (your regular e-mail ended with @kindle.com) for a ten-cent conversion charge (you'll be billed when your conversion balance reaches $3.00) or to your email @free.kindle.com (you then must drag-and-drop the file onto your Kindle from your PC, but there's no fee to convert the file).<br /><br />The Kindle also features a basic Web browser that handles text-only versions fairly well, and a built-in dictionary. You're able to highlight, put in page markers and add notes to Kindle books, making it a useful tool for study or research. There's a full QWERTY keyboard and a five-way toggle that takes some getting used to. The menu designs are drop down similar to Windows; you simply move through the various options using the five-way controller, then press down on it to select.<br /><br />The battery can hold a charge for up to four days with the Whispernet on; you'll get a much longer charge if you turn it off. It takes about three hours to fully charge the battery, but it's not user-replaceable; you have to mail your Kindle to Amazon.com for a replacement. The battery is covered for the first year after purchase, but it's $59 after that. The Kindle 2 also doesn't come with [[ASIN:B001JAH7OM Amazon Kindle 2 Leather Cover]], for which you'll have to shell out extra money unless you choose to store it in the box.<br /><br />If you love new technology and are looking for new ways to read / listen on the go, the Kindle 2 may be a good choice for you. But besides the initial expense, the Kindle versions of paperbacks are as expensive as their paper counterparts. Depending on your area, the Whispernet may not have a strong signal (and for now, the Kindle 2 is only available in the US, so overseas customers will have to wait). I love mine, but it's up to you whether it's worth the cost of the Kindle 2 and book downloads.",[],B00154JDAI,B00154JDAI,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1240780195000,False,2
5.0,My first camera was a knockout!,"After spending around six months scouring various digital camera reviews online and through magazines, I finally decided on the Canon Powershot A95 5 Megapixel camera as offering the perfect marriage of power and portability.  My first digital camera, I bought it as a going-away present for myself, since I was spending the summer living and working in Spain and knew that I needed a camera that could keep up with my travels.<br /><br />It was a snap to take out and set up, and intuitive enough that a couple of cursory glances at the Quick Start guide had me well on my way to pointing and shooting. The camera comes with a USB cable, several software programs, a 16 MB Compact Flash card (of course, you'll want to invest in more memory as soon as possible - with the highest-resolution photos, consider a 512 MB or larger card), batteries, and a wrist strap.<br /><br />I would rate the camera as mid-sized. It is not wafer-thin, but neither is it absurdly bulky or heavy. For most of my traveling around Spain, I simply slipped it into its bubble wrap and into a soft fabric bag, where it fit comfortably in my purse.  The design is comfortable to shoot with over long periods, and I found the layout of the buttons to be intuitive.  Less is more: there are few external buttons (shutter, on/off, menu and related buttons), and most controls are carried out through the on-screen menus.  The flip-out LCD screen is one reason I decided on this Canon over others in the PowerShot line; it makes previewing photos a snap, and can be swiveled 180 degrees.<br /><br />The photo quality (I kept it on large superfine) is astonishing: clear, sharp, vibrant photos (check out some of my uploaded photos using the Canon A95) in true-to-life tones with minute detailing. There are various shooting modes, including manual, macro, panoramic (with Stitch Assist software), nighttime, slow shutter, and more, and a movie mode that captures brief (jerky) videos with tinny sound. This isn't a camcorder, so I wasn't surprised that video quality wasn't better, since I bought this primarily for photos.<br /><br />You will also want to invest in a few basic accessories: rechargeable NiCad batteries and a rapid charger, a sturdy case, and a bigger memory card, for starters. Although the included software is capable enough to get the job done, consider upgrading to Adobe Photoshop Elements (around $90), or if you're a pro, Adobe PhotoShop CS 2 (several hundred dollars). An excellent first camera with plenty of power and a reliable name.",[],B0002OD3JY,B0002OD3JY,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1126444490000,False,4
5.0,A rollicking adventure through the African jungle,"It has to be said: although I'm a twentysomething, I still *love * to watch Nickelodeon cartoons, my absolute favourite being ""The Wild Thornberrys."" I've seen every episode (many more than once), and I was a little skeptical at the thought of a full-length animated movie.<br />Happily, the movie far surpassed my wildest expectations. The animation looks great, including the use of several CGI elements not present in the series (at some moments it reminded me of ""The Lion King""). There is enough background information included (including the opening credits of the series) that newcomers won't feel left behind. The whole Thornberry gang is here, including the addition of Nigel's parents, and several new characters as well. The voice work is fantastic, including such well-known names as Tim Curry as Nigel, Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea as Donnie, Rupert Everett as the baddie, and Marisa Tomei. The music is an eclectic mix of traditional and modern, featuring such talents as Sting, Dave Matthews, P. Diddy and Brandy, Youssou D'Nour, Sting, Baha Men, Nick Carter, Peter Gabriel and Hugh Masekela.<br />The story finds Eliza Thornberry, a twelve-year old with the magical ability to talk to animals, on a hunt for migrating elephants with her family, who are award-winning naturalists. Eliza's older sister Debbie is a moody, pop culture-obsessed Valley Girl who hates all the wilderness trekking. Donnie is the Bornean wild boy that the Thornberrys adopted, who is always causing trouble by making messes and stuffing things up his nose or down his pants. Darwin is Eliza's best friend, a chimpanzee with very human tastes, including his obsession with Cheese Munchies. Eliza starts out playing with the cubs of a cheetah friend, but when one of them is stolen by a poacher Eliza must rescue him. However, her parents send her to a London boarding school, where Eliza is miserable and doesn't fit in. The rest of the movie you'll have to see to believe!<br />There are some scary chase scenes, wounded animals and tense moments that might upset younger viewers, but overall ""The Thornberrys Movie"" does an excellent job of bringing the show to the big screen while remaining faithful to the humour, excellent ethnic music, and magical elements of the original series. One of the things that I love the most about the ""Wild Thornberrys"" is that the episodes take viewers all around the world, and the show's producers try to avoid ethnic stereotypes with the various characters, as well as adding authentic music and traditions. This is one cartoon that is witty, educational and downright fun for the whole family. There's something for everyone with ""The Wild Thornberrys Movie.""",[],B00005JLS3,B00005JLS3,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1046913665000,False,16

I set up my charging station next to the bed and discovered that the original phone cable that came with my new phone had Type C on both ends. My power strip only had USB outlets. I had another Type C charging cable to use while I was there, but I always like using the original ones with my phone. I ordered this when I returned home so I wouldn't have that issue next time. The power strip can accommodate many electronic devices. When I first tried it out it worked as expected but after a minute, it stopped. Nothing was getting power. My husband even used a power tester gadget he had and it was registering at zero. I was ready to throw it out at that point. However, I decided to try again the next day. Everything worked this time. And it has been working since then. I don't know what the problem had been, but it seems to be resolved.

4.0,Not What I Expected,"This film scanner was not what I expected and that's all my fault. I thought it was for scanning and converting negatives and slides. And that's what it is, but I don't have the right kind of negatives and slides. From what I can tell, it's for the film that goes in the Brownie cameras. I just assumed that the old slides that belonged to my Dad and to my inlaws, would work, but their cameras must have been 35 mm. We did give it a try with some negatives that were from 1990's and we could see how it worked. It does require batteries. The whole system is pretty simple. An iPhone would probably work really well with this. My husband and I both have Google Pixel 6 cameras and the camera doesn't line up with this as well as other phone cameras. I have a couple of slide scanners and I was thrilled with the idea of being able to convert them digitally to my phone instead of having to use an SD card and uploading that to my computer. I am going to ask my friends if any one has the 6x6 size negatives and slides.

However, I had several stickers that were sticking to one another. I provided a couple of pictures. You can see that the backing paper is slightly askew from the sticker which causes some of the adhesive to be uncovered. That allows the stickers to stick to one another. Very annoying! There were probably at least a dozen or more of them like this. I went through every sticker to pul out any that weren't kid appropriate.

He does say that he will probably buy a new graphics card so he can fully utilize the capabilities of this monitor.

It's adequate and I could hear everything, it's just not an amazing sound experience. With that being said, I got these to use when working at home, so they don't need to be an amazing sound. There's a mute button on the cord as well as volume control. The ear cups are comfortable. The band is adjustable.

5.0,Love These!,"I'm not one to use ear buds or head phones very frequently, but I saw these and for some unknown reason, I was interested. I followed the directions and charged them first before using them. They may have been partially charged to begin with, but I didn't check. Pairing it to my phone was probably the easiest pairing ever! There's a QRL code in the directions and scanning that was all it took. They are surprisingly comfortable to wear and don't annoy me at all. There are a couple of different sizes of the silicone ear piece  in case you need a larger or smaller size. I'm still learning how to use them, but I'm slowly getting the hang of it. Phone calls sound good and the recipients have been able to fully hear and understand me as well. You can lower or increase the sound by tapping the ear bud, but it's unnatural for me to do that, so about half of the time I keep using my phone to adjust the volume. I have been having fun with these!!",[],B09CGDZHC5,B09HJD942X,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1636583675630,False,1

They're a nice quality and very durable. His speakers are little larger than the shelf on the stand, but it doesn't seem to be an issue. Assembly was easy. He decided not to thread the cables through the stand mainly because they wouldn't be long enough since they have to reach the back of the computer. These stands are working well for what he needed.",[],B0931QN643,B0931QN643,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1633219475910,False,0

5.0,Fast!,"I have been using laptops for the past 30 years, and haven’t bought a new one since 2013.  It was a special treat getting this new DELL G3. I’m not a crazy gamer, but I do play games. I was attracted to this computer because I wanted performance, and I know gamers expect high performance!<br />PROS:<br />-FAST FAST FAST. It is by far the fastest computer I’ve ever owned. I often blamed my speed on my Internet connection -- but am now discovering that my computer itself was at least 75% of the  problem.<br />-The graphics card is amazing!  My 10yr old nephew tried out Minecraft, Java Edition on my laptop. He gave it a 98/100.  The Frames Per Second rate started around 90+.  He gave it the TNT test (a fast animation to stress out the frame rate) and the frame rate dropped 30 then immediately recovered to the high level.<br />-The keyboard glows blue. Not only is it super cool, it’s easy to see in low light.<br />-Compared to other laptops I’ve had, this one is MUCH cooler (ie you can actually put it on your lap without burning your legs!). Yay for thermal cooling!<br />-Great battery life. So far, I have had zero issues with battery life. According to the battery icon, a full battery should last about 5 hours - which I fully believe.<br />-The power cord has a blue light where it plugs into the computer so you KNOW it’s charging!<br />CONS:<br />-It’s heavier than any laptop I’ve had - I assume because of the robustness of the machine.<br />-The power supply is HUGE - Again, I have to assume because of the robustness of the computer, but it seems unnecessarily large.<br />-For me personally, the keyboard is different than I’m used to.  It has a numeric keypad on the right end of the keyboard -- so the QWERTY keys are not as central as I’m used to. There are raised bits on the F&J so you can find home base, and on the center of the number pad, which is good.

4.0,Fun Camera!,"My 19 year old daughter got an earlier model of the Instax when she was in high school. I'm guessing it was at least 4 years ago. All of her friends have one. It's pretty popular among teen girls. My daughter is in high school now and still likes using her Instax camera. She likes to decorate her room with the little pictures. She'll hang them on clothesline type display with mini clothespins. I thought she would like an updated model of it. She immediately noticed the addition of the selfie-mirror! She was quite pleased with that. I used it to take recent pictures of the cats for her dorm room. I have used one in the past, but it was always a matter of it being handed to me all ready to go.  I was able to figure out and operate it without any trouble, which if you knew me, that would mean a lot! We didn't really notice any difference in the picture quality. It may be something that she notices after more use.

4.0,Nice Picture Quality!,"This TV replaced one in our bedroom that we purchased in 2010. It's significantly thinner than the older one. It has a nice picture quality with a crisp image. It was easy to set up and was working within minutes. It comes with Alexa and Bixby on it, but to use Google Assistant, it requires you to download an app, which was a little disappointing. We haven't done that, but from what my husband found, it looks like it only allows you to turn the TV on and off or other simple tasks with Google. The remote is user friendly. The sound quality is okay. We haven't decided whether or not we'll get a sound bar for it. Overall, we like it. It's definitely a step up from the older TV.",[],B0845NT2HX,B089DF8FWN,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1596377830798,False,0

These was able to figure out how to pair them with my Android phone without too much trouble. The volume can be controlled by the actual ear buds or with my phone. I found that the earbud stayed better on my left ear than my right one. I had to keep molding the ear hook to stay put because it kept coming off. The sound quality is pretty good, at least as far as this novice goes. I like the little charging case that comes with it.

I personally only need 1 or 2 outlets max, so that's covered. Then my phone and watch use the USB ports. This works well, too. It doesn't say anything about being a fast charger, but the speed is good enough that it made me think that maybe it was. I like the smaller size because it doesn't take up a lot of room.

The Michael Kors one had 2 controls, too, but their location was always accidently getting bumped which sometimes caused it to restart when I didn't want it to. I have never accidently bumped these buttons. The strap that comes with it barely fits my wrist, but there's an extra longer one that comes with it. It comes with a charger. The watch claims to stay charged for days. Well, technically that's true. I find that it lasts for 2 days so every other day I need to recharge it. My former watches both had to be charged every night, so I am pleased that this lasts a little longer. As far as the fitness aspect, this is better than my other ones. The step tracking seems to be more parallel to what I used to get from my Fitbit. The other smart watches were always really low in my step count which frustrated me. It tracks heart rate and stress levels. You can track fitness routines. The messaging feature is good, but I find it a little more difficult to reply to texts than my other watches. It gives you some quick replies, but I don't like the choices as much as the other ones. Also, I find it more difficult to customize my text replies with the actual typing.

5.0,Powerful!,"My 21 year old son just recently replaced his older Dell Inspiron gaming laptop with this laptop. He was especially impressed with how powerful it is for its size because it's much smaller than the Dell, but more powerful. It doesn't come preloaded with a lot of unnecessary software which he really liked. His school is finishing for the semester, so he hasn't had to install any software such as Office yet, but he will have to sometime before his next semester starts up. Right now it has been a designated gaming machine. Most of his games are on the Steam platform, so he did download that. Team Fortress has been his primary game since getting this. The games run really well and has provided lots of highly satisfying game time. The keyboard lights up with different colors which is something he really likes with his computers. Overall, he is very pleased with this and says it is a high performance laptop.",[],B07MWRQGMC,B088GJHYVN,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1556384221083,False,3
4.0,Easy to Install,"My husband has installed a few different dash cams over the past few years. This one was easy to install. It fits over your existing mirror. It works pretty good for the most part. We did find it somewhat distracting. When you turn the car on, it starts out by showing you the view of the what the camera is seeing at that moment. You can set it so it turns off after a minute and goes back to the mirror view and blanks the screen. We just found that to be distracting. Other cameras that we have used don't do that. The actual camera quality is good, not great, but adequate. We haven't used the rear camera that is included because all of our cars already have rear cameras.",[],B07H9YR3XW,B07H9YR3XW,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1554667334790,False,0
5.0,Works Well!,My 21 year old son has regular gaming nights at our house. His friends all set up their lap tops on a table and they become quite the computer nerds.

4.0,Good Picture Quality,"Several years ago, we purchased digital frames for the grandparents. In comparison with those, this one looks much nicer and has a larger display. My tech savvy husband first tried to download the suggested app. He was unable to find the right one for his Android phone. There's a slot for an SD card, but it uses large SD cards which aren't as common anymore, so we didn't have any. It does allow for a flash drive to be inserted, so that's how we are using it. The picture quality is pretty good. We have been using high resolution pictures on it, so if you use lower resolution ones, it may not look as nice. When it's all said and done, we do like it, though we wish we could have gotten the cloud app to work with it.",[],B07LBQYCHT,B07LBQYCHT,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1552137193023,False,1

He has a few laptops that he uses for presentations but they were all at least a few years old. He installed this solid state drive into one of the laptops. The laptop speed was improved greatly! It has made a huge difference in the capabilities of the formerly outdated computer. Installation was easy, however, it may be more complicated for someone who hasn't done it before. It's definitely worth trying upgrades such as this before completely giving up on an older computer.

It easily accommodates the parts and pieces that he has accumulated so far. Some of the sides are tempered glass which makes me a bit nervous, just because he's a 20 year old!

She uses an iPhone, but I'm an Android user. She likes to use Facetime, but I don't have that. We both have Facebook. The device itself was easy to set up. I like the bonus of having Alexa with it. I do feel like it's a bit limiting on what it can do. I am hoping there will be updates and it will allow the users to do more. I would love to be able to look up things on it, other than Facebook stuff and be able to see it, such as recipes. I love how the camera follows you around. It's easy to pick up and move. Right now I keep it in the kitchen, but I will probably be moving it to the living room soon.

I do like how the ear cups rotate and the whole thing flattens up pretty well. I did find that the controls were a little too sensitive and I would accidently adjust the volume when not trying.

This compact design allows you to plug in your devices in  EU, UK, AUS, as well as the US.There's also a type C port.  I could have gotten by with just one of these for my charging needs. When you have limited luggage space, you want to pack minimally. I've tested this at home and it works fine here.

I have a large wrist and usually link bands don't fit at all.  I was able to take 2 links out and it was still a little loose, but with removing the 3rd link, it was too tight. Removing the links was just like the directions showed, but I found it a bit difficult to open up each link that I was removing. What I didn't care for about the wrist band was that it wasn't a simple process to put it on or take it off. It wasn't hard, but it was a pain. You have to slide it on/off to the actual Fitbit rather than using a clasp on the band. It's nice looking, but takes more time than my previous band to put on.",[],B07F2DDC28,B07F2DDC28,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1538941466167,False,0
4.0,Great Graphics!,"We weren't particularly looking for a gaming computer, but our 17 year old daughter was in the market for a new laptop. She had been using her brother's old laptop, but it wasn't powerful enough to run one of the games she wanted to play. It was basically an older, outdated laptop without the capability to run modern gaming software. She's going to college next year and needed something that would let her do school assignments on and allow her to stream movies too. She's pretty busy, but she does enjoy a good 3rd person shooter game now and then. This laptop has met all of her needs so far. She can do all three. It was easy to set up out of the box. Cortana talked her through it. She hasn't been able to figure out how to change the colors of the keyboard yet. We looked up videos online and they told us to go to the settings and select an option that isn't there. So for the time being, she's stuck with red lights. Battery time has been fine. She is usually near an outlet so there haven't been any issues yet with battery life. It's fairly light weight and fits in her backpack easily.

It also blocked out my voice when I called to him when usually he can hear me after a moment or so. These are light weight and comfortable to wear. It was simple to pair with his phone.

We've had water proof speakers before, but never one that could actually be put in the water and float around. We've put it directly in the hot tub and we've put it in the cup holders. What I really like about this is that there is all around sound. You don't have to position it with the speakers facing a certain direction just to hear it. You can hear it from all directions! The sound is pretty good, too. My daughter has used this in the backyard with friends and it was more than adequate. We have found it easier to control the volume with our phones than the actual device, but you can control it from the speaker, too. The light feature is fun at night. Our hot tub light bulb is out and needs to be replaced and this does the job for us. It was easy to pair with our phones.

4.0,Easy to Use,"We upgraded from a 2 camera Arlo system to the 6 camera one. First of all, the 2 camera system that we were using, allowed the cameras to be charged with a cable. The new ones use non-rechargeable ones. We've been using the new system for a few weeks now, and haven't had any low battery notifications, but it is a concern since we have 6 cameras! The system is easy to use. We love being able to access the cameras via our phones. When we were on vacation, we could tell when our pet sitter came to check on the animals. My husband can see when packages are delivered when he is downstairs in his office. We have been using one camera to find out which of our cats is not using the litter box! They're really handy. The quality of the images is very good, even when accessing it through our phones. When my husband was setting this up, he had to contact Arlo Customer Services. Evidently, you can only use 5 cameras without any extra fees. It was going to cost money to be able to use all 6 cameras. So as of now, we are only using 5 of them.

He was thrilled to learn that there was a rain cover. When he's walking on campus during rain, he will put his backpack under his raincoat which is always a bit awkward. It took me a while to find where this rain cover was stored. There's a zippered compartment on the base of the bag  that stores the cover. The straps are not super comfortable, but they're okay.

I can't wear them for extended periods of time because they annoy me after a while, and these are no different. I usually max out after thirty minutes or so. But I probably shouldn't be wearing them for extended periods of time either! They do seem to stay in place pretty well, even with physical activity, definitely better than ones without the ear hook. The sound quality is decent. I'm not a big audiophile, so for my needs, it sounds good enough.

It's much heavier than we expected. At first we thought we were going to have to bolt it down to the desk, but that's not the case. We were hesitant to permanently attach it to our furniture, but fortunately the base is strong enough to keep the attachment stable. It even holds up to our kitty's occasional bunting. Assembly was pretty easy. Picture directions are included and were simple enough to follow. It works better than expected. I thought it might be a pain to raise and lower it, but it's really not. The surface has enough space for the keyboard and mouse. Overall, this is pretty good. Though after using this for a several weeks, my husband thinks he would prefer a desk that completely raises and lowers  over this, but until he can afford to get one, this will do the job.",[],B01N7W9XUH,B076MJW31F,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1527597875369,False,0
4.0,Good Sound Quality,"I don't usually like ear bud style headphones because they don't stay in place very well, even if just sitting. These have the sports clip feature which helps keep them in place. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price in my opinion. I did find that even with the clip, the actual ear buds did pop out every now and then. And as far as comfort, I found that I couldn't wear them for very long because they would start to annoy me. That's not really a flaw in these specifically, I usually have this issue with all ear buds.

Installation was quick and took about five minutes top. It took a bit longer to copy everything over. He bought an inexpensive mounting bracket separately to hold it.

There were no instructions indicating where it might be. My husband found it completely by accident, located inside the bottom of the mouse. I have a different wireless mouse that had its receiver in the same spot, so I should have looked there first. The keyboard is regular size. The keys don't have to be pressed very hard to work.

He decided to bring it home and set it up in his home office. He was only using two monitors at home, so he started by setting those up on the stand. Set up was okay - not too complicated, but not simple either, but he was able to do it on his own. He found a third monitor to add to it. Mounting the monitors wasn't difficult. It's impressive how secure the monitors are on the stand. In addition to freeing up space on the desk, he's finding that the cat doesn't block as much of the screen as he did when the monitors were on the desk.",[],B01M716C56,B01M716C56,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1511126910644,False,0

The Epson one is significantly brighter than the VS one. The room doesn't have to be completely darkened to get a good image. We also use this with a real movie screen as opposed to a painted wall.  Images are also nice and clear.  We've mounted it on a homemade platform that my husband constructed. It has a decent speaker built in, but for movie watching, it's definitely better to have it connected to a home theater sound system. It's also much quieter than the View Sonic in terms of the fan cooling noise. The ViewSonic's noisy fan is the reason we acquired the older projector from my husband's boss.  The remote is easy to navigate.  There was no special set up was required.

Since it uses a lightening cable, we thought we would give it a try. It works wonderfully with her phone. She is very happy to be able to listen to music again without the use of a portable speaker.

This is also a little more rugged than those are, too. It's not only larger, but it's also pretty thin making it easy to transport. It won't take up much room in a backpack or tote bag. The sound quality is decent and a little better than the other portable BT speakers that I have - that could be the difference between a name brand such as Magnavox and the no name ones that I have. My husband and I like to listen to music outside on the patio or in the hot tub and this works very well for that. The volume gets loud enough for small gatherings, but probably wouldn't work for a large party where it would have to compete with talking and other noises.  The controls are easy to use and it was very easy to pair with my Android phone. There's a rubber covering that goes over the USB port which I found a bit difficult to replace, not impossible though. Just difficult. The handle is just a flexible piece of plastic or vinyl. Overall, I think it's a good quality BT speaker.",[],B06XFTNSCT,B06XFTNSCT,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1504608387607,False,0

He had a couple of cables, but he was still having to move them around as needed. I figured he could benefit from a few more cables. This set has three cables of varying lengths. The shortest one is just half a foot, and has been the least used because it is awfully short. I think a 1 foot one would have been a little better. He's been using some of these daily since they arrived and they work well. Charging speed is pretty good. They have a fairly tight (not loose) connection.

5.0,Works Great!,"This is one of those &quot;Seen On TV&quot; products that really delivers! I wasn't expecting much from it, but I have been pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure how it works, but it does a great job of projecting music. The sound quality is pretty good and it can get loud. My teenage daughter loves it! She has an iPhone 6, but the audio port/jack on her phone is broken. She can't use earphones/earbuds or AV cables with her phone. With this speaker, she can listen to music on her phone again which makes her quite the happy girl! We tried using it in the car and although it does work, we didn't have a flat, level place for it to sit, so she had to hold it which was a pain. But for at home or outside, this portable speaker is great!!! Batteries aren't included. There's a DC 5V port on it, but it doesn't come with any charger for it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612ArjZAe6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612ArjZAe6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612ArjZAe6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gplbcjKxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gplbcjKxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gplbcjKxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B06WRMP8KT,B06WRMP8KT,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1492974513000,False,0
4.0,Nice Scent,"I have tried natural deodorants before. I like the idea of using an aluminum free product on my skin. However, I find that I need more of an antiperspirant rather than a deodorant. This does have a nice smell, but I found that I was sweating more or at least more aware of sweating than usual. It glides on easily and does not crumble. It does not stain my clothes or leave white streaks behind. The scent is a natural one, not perfumy or floral. I can wear this on cooler days when I can by without an antiperspirant. But if it's a hot and humid day, or if I am more active than usual, I need more protection.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WThCkHRuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WThCkHRuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WThCkHRuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51dFGwR64DL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51dFGwR64DL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51dFGwR64DL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B017O1BWMW,B017O1BWMW,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1491445638000,False,2
4.0,Best Looking Smartwatch!,"The Misfit Phase is definitely one of the better looking smartwatches! My teenage daughter has been wearing this for the past couple of weeks. It has an almost elegant look to it. It looks more like a traditional watch than a fitness smart watch. My daughter did not have any problems pairing it with her iPhone 6s. The app has been very user friendly so far. Prior to this smartwatch, my daughter had a Jawbone Move Up activity tracker that she had difficulties syncing with her iPhone, so after a short while, she gave up and stopped using it. This device has not given her any troubles. As far as durability, the band appears to be a faux leather. There have been no troubles with the strap or buckle. The crystal glass on the face of the piece has been surprisingly sturdy. My daughter is on her school Winter Guard team and she has practice several times a week. She spins and tosses flags and does a lot of dancing. She admitted to me that there were a couple of times where she expected it to crack, but so far it's held up fine. She has it set up to give her phone notifications, but so far, that has not worked. She thinks it might be because she keeps her phone on silent all the time. She is going to keep working on that. I read some of the other reviews on this, and one mentioned that the buttons on it appeared to be upside down. She has the same issue. We thought it might be that we put the watch band on the wrong way, but that didn't fix it. It is still usable, but slightly unnatural. The sleep tracking is pretty accurate as far as her wake up time. If she is reading in bed or playing on her phone, it will sometimes calculate an earlier bed time than she actually had. Instead of keeping track of steps, it tracks points. She is pretty active, so she set hers with a comparable goal. She likes seeing the pie chart that shows how close she is to her daily goal.",[],B01N3JWG1N,B01N3JWG1N,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1490870105000,False,0
4.0,Fun Way to Share Pictures & Videos,"The Prynt case is a fun, easy way to print pictures from your phone. This works well with my daughter's iPhone 6. She had to download an app in order to use it. The app was user friendly. My daughter enjoys making gifs and videos, so she thinks it's fun to be able to add those to her pictures. The quality of prints is okay, but not as good as what she gets with her Fuji Instax Mini 8 camera. The pictures are printed on sticker paper so she's had fun with that. It prints a little key on the photo so you can scan and access the video, but the key is small and doesn't detract too much from the image. You have to download the app in order to view the video. You do not have to record the video when you are taking your picture - you can use a video you already have if you want. You have to remove the phone case in order to put the printer case on the phone to use. It comes with a 10 pack of film. The price for additional film is reasonable.",[],B017BK9RXC,B06XJF5NMP,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1483295415000,False,1
5.0,Easy to Use!,"This has been the easiest security system to install and use. Set up was quick and easy. The app that goes with it is very user friendly. I was able to figure out how to use it on my own which says a lot.  Prior to using Arlo Pro system, we have tried a no-name brand camera that worked so-so and most recently, my husband had been using our old cell phones (that did not work as phones any longer, but the cameras still worked). We are so impressed with how well these work. The images that we view on our cell phones are very clear. Since we have two cameras, it's a split screen on the phone so we can see both cameras at the same time. We have a couple of cats and a dog, so we have turned off the motion sensors for now. We were getting email notifications a little too frequently. The two way sound works as it should - we could see that coming in handy with the pets when we are away. The images aren't live when we first go to the app, but it doesn't take long to get the live images. The pets weren't too happy with the siren feature, but it is a nice feature to have. Plus, it's neat that we can control it off site through the app.",[],B01LR8PG6Q,B08739SDH3,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1482932529000,False,0

4.0,"Works Well, But a Little More Complicated Than Expected","We have multiple computers and printers in our home. Several of the printers are already wifi ready for easy printing. However, my husband's laser printer in his home office is older and does not have that feature. Now, with this USB wireless network port, we can print items to his printer from all over the house. When we opened the box, it gave us the impression that it was easy to set up and get started. My husband is a programmer and is very knowledgeable regarding computers and technology. He found that this was a bit more complicated than it was implied. Plus, he believes that it would be difficult for someone to install and set up if they don't have a good understanding about computer networking and IP addresses. He called tech support to find out why it wasn't working the first time and was told that it sometimes does that depending on the computer. The other method required using an Ethernet cable which he was able to do without the tech support. Once it was properly set up, it works well. His dealing with tech support was helpful, but he really wasn't expecting to have to contact anyone for help so he could set it up.",[],B00M77UME8,B09HJ4LVWP,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1478740732000,False,0

He's majoring in computers, and working Wi-Fi is imperative.  We gave him an old model Linksys router (WRT 54G)  that only supported A & B modes. He was not able to use the Wi-Fi for his phone, but it did work for his laptop. This newer Linksys model has been significantly faster, plus it supports his phone Wi-Fi and other devices as well as his roommate's computer and devices.  Set up was easy, straight out of the box. He is very pleased with how this performs.",[],B01JOXW3YE,B09LYWCHJX,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1478740033000,False,0
5.0,High Quality,"My husband has purchased Sennheiser headphones in the past and has been pleased with them. These live up to the Sennheiser name. They are lightweight, foldable over the ear headphones. They are great for travel or other situations where storage space is limited. They are adjustable to accommodate head size, but in a different way than most over the ear headphones I've tried. Instead of the actual headband part sliding apart to fit, the ear cups have about a two inch sliding range so you can move them up or down for the best fit. There will be less wear on the headband portion of the headphones for longer lasting results. The padding on the ear cups is about half an inch. The cups are comfortable to wear, even for extended time. Cups are labeled L/R, though it's black on black and a little difficult to see. The cable is a good length and seems to resist tangles so far. The sound quality has been excellent. I immediately noticed a difference between these and the inexpensive no-name headphones that I was using before these. I do not claim to be an audiophile, but for my entertainment purposes, I found the sound to be clear and crisp. There is no volume control other than on your device, though there is a small button so you can answer phone calls.

5.0,No Loss of WiFi Throughout the House!,"We live in a large two story house plus a basement. We were having to keep three separate  Linksys WiFi routers (extenders) in our house, one on each floor prior to this. We were constantly having to switch networks in order to get any kind of signal as we moved around the house. Our teenagers were always getting frustrated with the drop outs. My husband was always having to tell them to switch WiFi routers. We've been using this router for about three weeks now and we have not had any trouble at all. We are keeping it located on the main floor in the living room. It easily reaches the bedrooms upstairs and the far corners of the basement. This can be used as a gateway or an extender. We are using it as an extender with our Comcast gateway to give us the WiFi throughout the house. If you don't have a gateway, It can be both a gateway and provide the WiFi too if you need it. Our Comcast gateway does not have WiFi. The strength of the signal has been full. It is amazing how much better this is performing. Our daughter has not complained once about not having any WiFi signal. It is larger than our previous routers. We have it positioned behind the TV in the living room on the entertainment stand. The speed has been great. We use anywhere from 7 devices to 12 at any one time. And if the kids have friends over, that number is more. My husband is a programmer and works at home a few days a week. He has been especially pleased with this new router. It has not interfered with his work. The antenna in the picture shows them pointing straight up, but it works much better if they are each at a 45 degree angle as mentioned in the manual.",[],B00PVCV682,B00PVCV682,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1476358543000,False,1

When the lenses have smudges and finger prints on them, it's really difficult to see through them and I have found it causes eye strain. I have a few microfiber cloths that have come free with purchase, but they are all boring gray or black colors and some of them are on smaller than I would prefer. The size of these cloths is perfect! Not too small or too big. I love the sweet, pastel colors too. I keep one in my purse, one in my desk at work, one in the living room next to my recliner and one on my night stand.

Then it lights up when it's plugged in and has a pretty blue glow which resembles my keyboard when I have turned its back light on. There are 4 ports on this hub and they all work fine. My own laptop has only two ports, so having some additional ports comes in handy. It doesn't take up too much room, so I can easily store it in my laptop bag. The cord is a good length.

With that being said, I still think that this is a great case. I have one kid going to college this year and the other in high school, so we will need to purchase a new calculator, so I am confidant that we'll get some use out of it. My son has never had a case for his calculator, so I love that there are protective cases for those high priced items. This has a hard exterior. There's a zipper compartment inside. The calculator is secured in place with some elastic and velcro. The zipper glides well, too. Overall, I think this is a much needed item.

5.0,Works Well,"We got rid of satellite TV a couple of years ago. We have two TVs in the house, but only one HD over the air tuner. We're looking to get another tuner, so with a second tuner, we need a second antenna. We tested this antenna with our existing tuner. It requires a USB port to be plugged in. We didn't attach it to our wall since we plan to use it in a different room and this was just a test. My husband held it up and was able to get a clear picture with it. Our living room has a two story ceiling. Our other antenna is up pretty high on the wall. The higher it was, the better the reception. The antenna is comparable to our other one in quality and performance.

5.0,Great for Videos and Pictures,"This photo studio table top set is really cool! I have a teenage daughter who loves photography and also likes making her own videos. This kit is perfect for her. She has it set up on her desk and is able to set it all up so she can film/photograph without any background disturbance. The “box” itself is collapsible and easy to put up. There are four different solid colored background sheets which are made from a sturdy, non-reflective material. There are 4 lights – 2 halogen and 2 LED ones. Their stands are built into the base of the lights and can be adjusted easily. The tripod is nothing fancy, but she already has one, so if her needs require a bigger tripod, she’s good. It’s taking her a bit of time to figure out which lights are best for various situations, but she’s having fun with it. My husband even used it to take pictures of something he is selling on an online auction site. The “box” has some storage pockets and almost everything can fit into those so it doesn’t take up much room. We are using this for fun and it works great.

5.0,Makes a Huge Difference!,"First of all, I am not a tech person. I am the wife of a tech person. We have a 3 story house and prior to getting this, we had 3 different wifi points. However, the top floor was always iffy. It was especially frustrating when my husband and I would try to stream a show on Netflix or Amazon Prime and it kept buffering and buffering. It got to the point that we wouldn't even try to watch TV upstairs. My husband was talking to a co-worker who had success with this, so we decided to try it. It's made a huge difference. Since we installed it, we have not had any difficulties streaming. Plus our other devices have noticed an improvement in the wifi, too. It works just as it is supposed to work.

Because of the location of our light switches, we usually open the door first before turning the light on. With our new Mpow solar powered light, she activates that light before we flip the switch. The light only lasts for 15 seconds, but that gives her enough time to see where she is going until we've flipped the switch. This was easy to install and it's easy to use.

So when the Indigo Marble Protective Camera Cover was available during a recent promotion, I couldn't wait to order it! When it first arrived, she wasn't quite sure what to think of it. Then I explained what it was and how it worked. The look on her face when she &#34;got it&#34; was priceless! Since she doesn't like using her case, she has been wrapping her camera up in a small towel when she takes it places. This wrap is way better than using a towel!

My Dad was so pleased with how they turned out! Yes, there were some fading issues, but that was expected. There were many slides that didn't have any fading problems. The worst slides regarding the fading were the ones that my Dad had purchased at the Kennedy Space Center & the Indianapolis Motor Speedway! We've scanned over 1000 so far in a matter of a few days. We purchased cans of air to spray on the slides to help remove dust. After one evening session of scanning, we decided to order an extra set of the trays. That sped things up a lot.

4.0,"Large aperture, nice bright images, but hard to clean","Overall this is a nice affordable zoom lens.  The aperture is nice and big offering great light collection. Used with my Celestron astromaster 130EQ, it doesn't maintain focus across the entire zoom range, requiring about a quarter turn of focus adjustment from 8 mm to 24 mm.  And yes mine does rattle too.  There are four lenses total, and the spacers and mechanisms aren't well-matched.  But none of this really impacts the quality of the images.  I unscrewed it all and tightened it which helped some, but not much.  I use some basic eyeglass lens cleaning wipes which unfortunately introduced more lint than it removed.  The Eclipse cleaning solution works well combined with a lint-free pad.  The focal points across the range typically focus precisely on at least one of the lens surfaces.  Which means that any tiniest piece of lint or speck can foul an image, especially bright ones.  So be prepared for that, and if the internal lenses are clean and you're trying to fix a slight rattle by opening it up, my advice is don't!  This aside, the lenses themselves are good quality, and I'm pleased with the bright sharp images and large field of view I can get with this zoom lens for the price.",[],B0007UQNV8,B07TXHPB39,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1527006951947,True,9

Last week I was transmitting but no one was hearing me. Well turns out it was an intermittent open circuit in the antenna.  I confirmed it with a multimeter.  Not sure if my radio was damaged I think protection circuitry or an overheat caused it to not actually transmit for long with no antenna load.

Incidentally, there are two companies that are authorized resellers of Baofeng radios, and the BF-F9V2+ is only sold by this one, Firstvision Technologies aka Amcrest in Houston, TX.  This model is essentially the same as the BF-F8HP with a slightly different shell design which looks more conformal and ruggedized to me.  This BF-F9V2+ comes with a BL-5 1800mAh battery that slides and snaps easily in place securely and conforms in size precisely to the radio itself.  The battery can be charged  by itself or with it installed on the radio using the same charger and cradle. The assembly, shell, switches, and buttons on this BF-F9V2+ are rock solid and actually has the Baofeng name molded in the plastic in more places than the BF-F8HP.  .  .  and it's a 9 which must be better than an 8, right? ;)  It's a nice radio I'm happy with it so far.",[],B00PTJ43FU,B00PTJ43FU,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1516000512080,True,1
2.0,Fuzzy images.  Not a good choice for a first telescope.,"This isn't a good first telescope, if the intent is to introduce and encourage someone to pursue the hobby of astronomy further.  The images were fuzzy and distorted and varied in focus across the field of view.  Any reflector telescope, even this small one, requires the mirrors to be precisely aligned (collimated) to get sharp images.  Out of the box, the two mirrors were not aligned well.  I did take it apart.  I unscrewed the primary mirror holder from the bottom and drilled out larger diameter holes so that I could adjust the positioning of primary mirror  I reseated the secondary mirror (below the eyepiece) which was not level.  The 3 existing screws in the secondary mirror can be adjusted to adjust the alignment of the secondary mirror.  After some manual collimation, the image is now much better.  Stars no longer look like fuzzy balls.  But this process isn't easily done in this telescope, nor is it described in the included instructions.  Reflector telescopes can be quite persnickety because of their need to be precisely adjusted.  My advice is to either spend more money on an reflector which has better optics which can be collimated, or choose a refractor telescope which I think is easier to use for a beginner and doesn't require such adjustments such as this one for not much higher cost:<br />Celestron 21035 70mm Travel Scope https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001TI9Y2M/ref=cm_sw_r_other_taa_QTn5zbPV2FBNX",[],B001UQ6E4Y,B00MG1VGMW,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1508172019621,True,4

When I tighten it either the left or the right side rubber pieces move up and off the mount along with my phone.<br /> So I have to take those rubber pieces off which means there might fair amount of pressure on the phone on the sides.  There also isn't really a tilt function which would be useful to help get the right distance from the eyepiece.  An better design would also provide an optional piece that would cradle the phone along the bottom, this would solve this problem of having to grip it on the sides alone to hold it in place.",[],B01J9F19I8,B01J9F19I8,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1508063926918,True,0

4.0,A good compact stereo bluetooth speaker,"I own the A3143 Premium Stereo Bluetooth speaker (2x10W=20W) which sounds great, but it doesn't have a microphone or the longer battery life of this lower-cost A3102 SoundCore speaker (2x3W=6W).  The features and sound characteristics are different, but which is the better choice depends on personal preference.  To me based on sound quality alone, the A3143 wins hands down. The bass is stronger (more power is required to drive the lower frequencies than the higher frequencies), but I also find overall frequency response to be more balanced and accurate for instruments and vocals. For either speaker, I'd recommend using an EQ app to set the frequency response and spatial effects to your preference (I use Bass EQ from Coocent).  Interestingly, the maximum volume level for both the A3143 and this A3102 SoundCore are about the same.<br /><br />The A3102 has a brighter sound overall.  The A3102 is good as a general purpose speaker, and it is excellent to use with a cell phone.  The A3102 microphone (which the A3143 doesn't have) and speaker quality for voice calling are crisp and clear.  My dad who can't hear very well often could not understand me on my cell phone handset or its speakerphone, but had no problem when I used the A3102.<br /><br />So for long battery life, good overall music speaker, and particularly for use as a microphone/speakerphone for voice calls, A3102 is a good choice.

THE PICTURES AND DATE IN THE STYLEBOOK ARE FOR CONSULT ONLY IF THERE IS FLUCTUATION...&#34;  (Not sure this is a &#34;right&#34;... sounds more like an &#34;adopted business practice&#34; to eschew product configuration management).  Well, I reserve the &#34;right&#34; to return for refund a product that isn't the same as what's in the pictures.<br /><br />So in other words you might receive the product shown in pics 1-2, or pics 3-4, or something different.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  My negative review starkly contrasts with the glowing 5-star reviews from the many reviewers who received this product free in exchange for a review.  However, since I PAID FULL PRICE for this item, my standards may admittedly be somewhat higher.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JHgU-pw-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JHgU-pw-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JHgU-pw-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B011KPIZ9G,B011KPIZ9G,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1441656655000,True,44

4.0,"A nice microscope for the money, AmScope honored warranty after a few months","I like everything about this microscope except for 1) the mechanical stage and 2) AmScope not honoring their warranty terms.  I ordered this microscope directly from AmScope.  After a few months of use, the arm on the mechanical stage broke off.  I requested warranty service, sent in pictures, and was told I would be advised when a replacement arm or stage was approved and shipped.  But I never did hear from AmScope.  The warranty request was effectively denied though I believe the claim was quite valid.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amscope did finally honor the warranty after a few months and did send me a new mechanical stage.  Apparently during a personnel transition my approved RMA didn't get passed along to the right departement.  Or something.  But I'm a happy Amscope customer now.  They do make a quality product for the price.",[],B006FD5RQ8,B006FD5RQ8,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1396634553000,False,11
5.0,Economical replacement,"From the looks of it, this is an exact replacement for my original lamp which logged about 3800 hours.  Although my old bulb didn't burn out or pop, I got a warning message from the projector that the lamp lifetime was up.  And what a difference a new lamp makes. The new lamp was brighter the color accuracy was much improved compared to the old lamp I replaced.  Apparently these lamps lose their brightness and ability to provide true white over time.  The picture looked as good as when I first used my projector brand new.  It's better to buy the bulb with the housing such as this product rather than just the bulb alone.  There's significant precision in the design of projector bulbs and their housing.  The less you handle it the better. A drop-in replacement is the way to go. Strong burning smell at first which disappeared after the first day of use.

Though outside the 30 day return window, Amazon is allowing me to return it as a courtesy since so close to the 30 day return window.  Was the card bad?  Or did the Galaxy Tab fry it?

5.0,A Solid Router,"I bought this to replace my Netgear WGR614 and what a difference!  Previously I would get 2-3 VPN drops a day with the Netgear router from a laptop just a few feet away.  Just swapping that router for the DLink DIR-655, I have maintained a continuous connection for over 3 days.  I'm also getting better range on all devices - at least Good reception for all devices throughout my house.  I'm using VOIP now, and there are very few stutters / warble using this router, possibly due to the QoS features.  I'm using the DLink entirely in wireless mode, and it manages 6 wireless devices of various types (laptops, iPods, game adapter, desktops) well with no dropouts.<br /><br />The only slight installation issue I had was not a problem with the router but with one of my legacy devices, a Netgear WGE111 game adapter connected to my Xbox.  The WGE111 doesn't support WPA-2, so I had to set the DLink router to WPA-Personal, WPA Mode:WPA Only, Cipher Type: TKIP.  Those were the only changes I needed to make to the default setup of the DLink router.<br /><br />My router was H/W Ver.:B1  F/W Ver.:2.00NA  A Fry's salesperson told me that there were some dropout issues with some of the older firmware versions.",[],B000LIFB7S,B000LIFB7S,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1287499750000,False,2

Also has a cool light and can be paired with other doss speakers for fuller/louder sound. My review is based on the one DOSS party boom speaker. It’s light weight which may save your arm but probably contributes to distortion if you try to crank the volume. My biggest grip is there is no battery level indicator. I have a ION block rocker that $20 more than this is currently selling for. It cam with a microphone and the sound is better cranked up. It also tells you how much battery is left. The only thing the DOSS has over the ION is the lights, weight it’s $20 cheaper. Do your research find out which one works best for you.

5.0,Workhorse with plenty of horsepower.,"First there is a cool factor of owning an Alienware product, the look and design of this laptop are several notches above what other laptops look like. I own MacBook 2020, and two other Dell laptops. This by far looks the coolest, but what we really care about is what's under the hood.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned the display wasn't 4k but screen size is small enough to where it actually looks a bit sharper than my LG Ultrafine 4K displays. Color looks great.<br /><br />I tried to run a user benchmark a few times with no luck for some reason. Wanted to see how it compared to my workstation. Tried updating drivers but still had issues with testing the GPU performance. So I decided to do an actual test with one of the tasks I do the most, video editing.<br /><br />I recently bought a Dell workstation for editing a couple months ago and wanted to compare it with the m15 R4. My workstation specs i7-10700K, GeForce RTX 2060 Super, SSD, 32GB RAM. As a hobby I do a lot of video/photo editing. I have a couple decades of IT experience.<br /><br />A little background. I switched to shooting in 4k 60 FPS with my DSLRs and drone footage. Even the most powerful consumer systems available 3-4 years ago have a hard time ripping these massive files and it's almost impossible to get any performance while editing. I use Adobe Premiere for all my video editing.<br /><br />I took one of my more complicated Premiere projects and did a few tests. Both systems did a great job in edit, meaning little to no lag while scrolling through a massive timeline at 100% playback resolution. Once again this is 4K video all at 60FPS, need emphasize that.<br /><br />Ripping/Rendering this 45 min project with GPU assistance took 37 mins on my workstation and 42 min on the M15. This same edit on my MacBook took just over 2 hours and was only half way at 4 hours with my older Dell laptops.<br /><br />Overall very pleased with the video editing performance from the m15  As far as gaming goes my son plays fortnight and gets over 200 FPS with the M15.<br /><br />Everything else works as expected. Multi color backlit keyboard looks great.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6128cWrGGWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6128cWrGGWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6128cWrGGWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08XDX7CW8,B08XDX7CW8,AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,1619287216823,False,6

5.0,"Fast, Small and huge capacity.",Excellent flash drive that’s unbelievably small. I’ve used this drive recently on a 2 week vacation. I have several cameras and took about 5000 pictures and video. Most pics were RAW and video all in 4K 60 FPS. Needless to say I filled this thing up by the end of my trip. I use this attached to tiny laptop and also backup all the media to google photos. Unfortunately Google photos doesn’t back up full res... yet.

The instructions aren’t the best, found out for arc audio it need to be in TV input. But it works fine with my Samsung TV and remote.<br />The sound is good for TV and Music but isn’t going to fill you house with music, but fine for one room. The app works well on my iPhone and gives me plenty of options. I can also use the Alexa app to play music with other streaming services iHeart Radio etc. The on board Alexa app has some bugs that need to be worked out and I don’t think you can connect/group speakers at this point.

It's very intuitive.<br /><br />Note: You will have to register with the FAA for this drone, if you have not done so already and add you reg label to it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Flying time lasts about 30ish min. Comes with 33GB Mico SD card. Remote is easy to use and my Iphone X Max pairs well with it to see live video feed. Comes with extra propellers. Easy to store or travel with.  Video is 4k resolution up to 60 frames per second (4K60, 2.7K60, 1080p120, 720p240). Range is said to be over 4 miles but there is no way I would feel comfortable flying it that far. I have flown it as far as 1.2 miles away and video was still working. Max speed is 34MPH, but can do sport mode that is faster.<br /><br />Cons:<br />My only con was when charging the remote it started making noise, like the fans were running inside it.

Also take note in order to do this at same coax location I had to get a splitter and 2 additional coax cables, easy enough because I had a bunch of that laying around.

But for just 329 (+ tax from Sony direct) I can't complain.  The wireless internet access is the key feature that sold me, and it works fine.<br /><br />PROS:  Wireless internet works well w/Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, etc. and was easy to set up (using a wireless-G router two rooms away and no problems); very diverse selection of online content (more than Samsung); 720p is no problem; sound is very good; doesn't get hot; energy efficient; no dead or stuck pixels; no noise or buzz; very good HD and SD picture quality which did not require a ton of calibration out of the box -- just set it to Theater mode and it works.<br /><br />CONS:  Usual LCD problems (as mentioned above) but not worse than any other LCD; base doesn't swivel; remote is kind of clunky to use and doesn't light up; only one USB port and that's occupied by the wireless internet device; not a lot of picture controls compared to the Samsung; not great when there's lots of motion on screen (only having a 60hz refresh rate doesn't help); the black plastic frame around the screen is very soft and scratches easily.<br /><br />Overall I'm satisfied.  It does what I need it to do and for not a lot of money, and some channels look better than my Samsung that cost more than twice as much.

4.0,Very good TV with typical LCD shortcomings,"Got this, my first HDTV, for $749 total delivered.  Seems like a great deal.  Has the AA01 panel:<br /><br />PROS:  Very good HD picture, which becomes stunning with good source material (after calibrating the picture); excellent SD picture (better than the good CRT TV it replaced); tons of controls for picture calibration; streaming Netflix is great, the Pandora app has become my household's new source for music of all types, either through the TV speakers or piped to the stereo; ethernet makes upgrading firmware and internet apps very easy; lots of connectivity; easy to set up; light; swivel stand works well; power efficient; doesn't get hot; no noise or buzz; no dead or stuck pixels; has analog audio out jack (important for old A/V receivers); functions as an outstanding computer monitor (with DVI-to-HDMI cable); glossy screen helps picture and repels dust; can't even notice the red ""Touch of Color"" design.<br /><br />CONS:  Though black levels are generally very good, when the screen and room are both dark you can see some flashlighting around the corners and some bleedthrough of the backlight; very fast motion on screen will cause brief pixelization and loss of picture clarity (has to be very fast motion -- football and other sports look great); picture quality degrades quickly as you move off-center (though not as much as in some other LCD TVs); requires major picture calibration out of the box (I used settings found in reviews of this TV on the web, tweaked them a bit to preference, and the picture's much better, though it's hard to get it right); most of the current internet apps are useless; the factory preset modes are useless.<br /><br />Overall it's a very good TV, with a picture that can sometimes be mesmerizing.  And I'm glad I paid a bit extra for the C650's internet connectivity and glossy screen.

2.0,Does nothing special that a real camera can't,"A friend of mine bought one of these to take video of his kids.  I tried it.  It works fine for what it is and takes decent video, and I can see why people may not want a full-blown camcorder, but in the market today it makes no sense.  Do yourself a favor and just buy a plain old digital camera instead because almost every cheap digital camera can do what a Flip does except better and sometimes for less money too.<br /><br />Take for example the Canon SD750, which does everything the Flip does and much more for just around $30 extra plus a few bucks for a larger memory card.  It takes good VGA video exactly like a Flip, plays it back on a 3-inch color screen with sound (four times larger than the Flip's 1.5-inch screen) in four different speeds of slow-motion if you want, has a real 3X optical zoom and a 4X digital zoom (Flip is 2X digital zoom only), uses SD memory cards that can easily and cheaply be upgraded and changed (with Flip you're limited to 2GB only and then you have to offload, while a 8GB card costs around $12), and like the Flip it can also play back video directly from the camera through a TV.<br /><br />BUT you can also record video in different resolutions, with effects such as B&W and sepia tones, at different frame rates from 15fps to high-speed 60fps, either in full automatic exposure or with manual tweaks to things like white balance, with stop shutter action where the camera will take one frame every one or two seconds and then play it back as a video, etc.  Or you can just leave it in full auto mode in which case it takes less than three seconds from the time you turn it on to the time you start recording.  It gets along with Windows just fine without any software all (it comes with software but you don't have to use it).  And of course it takes fabulous 7.1 megapixel regular pictures with an enormous number of features.<br /><br />I use the Canon SD750 as an example only because I'm familiar with it.  But almost any digital camera will do what the Flip does and more, and many of them will do it for the same price or even less.  So to me at least it makes no sense to get a Flip unless you're willing to spend more money for simplicity or only want it for the cute factor.",[],B000V1MLBE,B000V2H136,AER6WLSJPBPNOZIQWVHQBVOKTNCA,1212680359000,False,8

No more restarting my router every other day to get it to work, and NO MORE NETGEAR FOR ME!  There's a reason I guess why their routers are less expensive.  Do yourself a favor and pay the extra ten dollars for another brand like Linksys.<br /><br />If you do buy this one note that when I followed the instructions on the included setup CD it didn't work.  When I just did the setup manually it worked fine.

5.0,Great little camera,"Ultra compact cameras like this one don't take pictures as nice as SLRs, but the best camera is the one that you use and not the one that sits at home.  And with the size and weight of this Canon you'll use it everywhere.  Another huge consideration is LCD size.  Despite its small size the SD750 has a 3-inch LCD which is bright and crisp.  The size difference over a 2.5-inch LCD is a lot more than it sounds like because it's measured diagonally.  Definitely get a big LCD no matter what camera you buy.<br /><br />As for photo quality, the SD750 is better than any other compact digital I've seen.  In full automatic mode under the right conditions (good light, stationary subjects, etc.) the photos are outstanding.  In less than perfect conditions if you want great shots you'll be well served to learn the controls and particularly the numerous scene modes.  My indoor shots in moderate light were coming out overexposed in the foreground and dark in the background, but once I started using the Indoor mode those shots looked great.  The Cloudy mode really helps bring out the colors in outdoor shots on cloudy days (as intended).  Take a little time to learn scene modes and other settings like High ISO and the different types of autofocus and you'll get much more out of this camera than if you just use full auto all the time.<br /><br />As for special features, there are more on this camera than I would ever use.  Color swap modes, red eye reduction, slide shows and all kinds of stuff I'm sure I'll never touch.  I just want to take good pictures.  If I want to edit my pictures I'll do it on my computer and not in the camera.  But if that's your thing you'll be kept busy for a long time playing around with all the stuff the SD750 has to offer.<br /><br />Finally, a great thing about the SD750 is the SPEED.  It's much faster starting up and taking shots than any other digital camera I've used.  From pressing the ON button to being ready to shoot takes less than a second.  Master the art of pre-focusing your shot by pressing the shutter button halfway and then framing your shot after it's focused and you'll virtually eliminate all shutter lag.  And oh yeah, the battery lasts a long time, though it would be nice if there was a battery indicator to tell you how much charge is left.",[],B000NK6J6Q,B000OSLLPG,AER6WLSJPBPNOZIQWVHQBVOKTNCA,1208838182000,True,2

It had everything I wanted plus 8 gigs of (expandable) memory.  But after learning how to use it, loading it up with music, pics and videos, and trying it for two days I sent it back.  Pros and cons:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Great (expandable) capacity at a great price.  Comparable Samsung and Creative products don't come close to holding this much music, video, etc.  There's a reason after all why memory is the number one selling point for MP3 players.<br />- Good screen.  Not as nice as the Samsung T9 (which is amazing), but still pretty nice.  Video and photos look good as long as you're looking from straight ahead.<br />- Good tactile control.  I really like the scroll wheel, which makes it easy to quickly cycle through menus and hundreds of songs.  With the Creative Zen V Plus and the Samsung T9 you're at the mercy of the joystick or button.<br />- FM radio that's recordable.  This is important to me.  I passed on the Creative because it doesn't record radio.  I wouldn't even consider an iPod because it has no radio at all (!!!).<br />- User-replacable battery.<br />- User interface is fast.  That's important.  A big strike against the Samsung is that it takes 3-4 seconds just to skip to the next song.  When it comes right down to it, usability is key.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- FM reception is bad.  I live in a large city with lots of powerful FM stations that come in clear as day on every radio I've ever used.  But not with this thing.  Listening to FM is like listening to someone crumple a plastic bag.<br />- Recording functions are lame.  The FM record level is so low that even at full playback volume it's hard to hear the recording while on the train(which is OK because it just records lots of static anyway).  The voice recording lacks sensitivity.<br />- Scratches easily.  I was as careful as I could be with my new toy, and my first day taking it out of the house it still got 4 or 5 small scratches on the front before I even got to work in the morning.  Those little scratches are clearly visible and distort the light.  I can only imagine what it would look like after a few months.<br />- User interface is just adequate.  Wanna make a playlist on the fly?  Good luck, because you have to play each song first in order to add it to the list.  Wanna cue up the next song while listening to something else?  Good luck, because I couldn't find any way to do that very basic function (if it's there it's not readily apparent).  There are plenty of other quirks.  All in all, it looks cool but isn't that easy to use.<br />- The four outside buttons are a pain.  Control wheel is great.  Buttons around the control wheel?  Not so great.<br />- It's not large, but it is larger than its competitors.  The Samsung T9 is 1/2 inch shorter and about 35% thinner.  The Creative Zen V Plus is thicker but also much shorter.  The iPod nano is of course much, much thinner and lighter.<br />- Volume is lacking.  Even with MP3s that I know have high volume, the e280 can sometimes require turning up the volume very high to get the sound you want.<br />- Editing MP3 tag information does no good once your files are loaded onto the machine.<br /><br />So........overall I was disappointed and I thank Amazon for taking it back and refunding my money.  The e280 is much better to talk about than to actually use.  If FM and recording performance isn't important to you then you should add one star to this review.<br /><br />And here's a tip if you do buy the e280 -- make sure the ID tag info on your MP3s is in order BEFORE you load up the machine.  Because changing the tag info once the machine is loaded up won't make the album, artist and song menus any better.

2.0,"Not  good ""gaming"" laptop","I bought this as a replacement for my 1200 dollar helios 300 that was 4 years old. I thought the technology would've improved that a 800 dollar new laptop would perform better then a 4 year old 1200 dollar computer. I was wrong. I averaged 60 fps with major lag spikes in teamfights in League of legends a 10+ year old game. I expected 120+ with the screen at 144hz. But it wasn't the screen holding me back it was the gpu, I guess. Also had poor performance in Dota 2. I wouldn't recommend this laptop. Also the volume on the speakers never rose over 50% it seemed. I couldn't hear the other players voices in dota 2 with everything on max. It was the computer, my note 20 is faster, clearer, battery stronger, and a smoother experience in League of Legend wild rift. So if you don't mind dying everytime there are more the 1 thing going on like single player games, go ahead and get this. But if you want to be frustrated every time you play, go ahead and get this ""gaming"" laptop. I didn't even try any of the AAA games, so maybe it's just the games I play.

5.0,Versatile for Phone/ DSLR Camera,"UPDATED: Earlier Review: ""Right out of the box to test use with my Android and Camera. The Android is a Galaxy J7 Crown and on that phone I had put an outer casing to protect it (since the phone on its own is very thin). The Clamp for use with a phone was able to fit snugly over both, but it was very tight. I've since been contacted Ubeesize , voluntarily without my having contacted them, that they can provide a large clamp for the phone due to the phone casing. . Then tried seeing how it would work with a Canon T3i DLSR camera . As can be seen in the images , success! The portion that attaches to the bottom of camera has a nice little 'knob' for screwing in quite tightly (as does the mount for screwing the camera on). These little knobs could be easily missed. In other words,  all fit on 'Tight' in all ways and the legs are very flexible. Will be interested to see all this will come down out in the field, but inside, for common use so far, great. Only thing, I'm afraid I could lose the removable part (detachable base),  as it is very small (Make a mental note)."" UPDATE: A new , larger mount is available that swivels from 'Landscape' to ""Portrait' position without having to remove the camera mount, as it previously was. Would highly recommend this 'improved mount' , also pictured.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61bEIwgefLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61bEIwgefLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61bEIwgefLL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712eOBcENRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712eOBcENRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712eOBcENRL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bRH7TFgFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bRH7TFgFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bRH7TFgFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dqNSluEsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dqNSluEsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dqNSluEsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uMJk4zPVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uMJk4zPVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uMJk4zPVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gLgzEPSmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gLgzEPSmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gLgzEPSmL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07837W5NX,B07837W5NX,AHYDLAYCM6W7T5UUIBO63FV3SAFQ,1556310685465,True,1

5.0,"""Heavy Weight"" with Solid Sound","The product arrived very quickly, within 4 days. When I saw the box at the doorstep and went to pick it up. was shocked at how heavy the relatively small box was. Good sign! At least I knew it wasn't made out of ' Plastic from China'. My previous  Desktop 6 CD changer had long stopped working, as it would not 'read' discs as was the case with the previous one . After reading multiple reviews of multiple 'Table Top"" multi-CD changers (all- in  -ones) It seems that is a recurring theme.<br /><br />I have a few hundred CDs and already started Ripping them to hear on the phone via Bluetooth, but if I could just find a single CD player that would be reliable with Blue Tooth and perhaps even a slot for a USB stick (I could get into that too).<br /><br />This player seemed to be the ticket and it is. The user guide is very large with pictures,  though the instructions are not 'the best', but the player really is simple enough. If you can work one in a car, then this is no different.<br /><br />I connected the speakers which didn't take long, the ones from my previous player, and was up and running within 5 minutes. T . The sound quality is far better than my previous player which size wise was much larger.<br /><br /> . Actually, from the time I took it out of the box to the time I was listening to the first CD in it, was about 20 minutes (with the Blue tooth connected by then too). I shared some photos with a CD beside the player in this review so you can compare how big it is. The volume for my 2 bedroom condo is great, wouldn't need anything any louder, and it's clear sound (even with the likely very cheap speakers I have right now). So far, it's only Day 1 having it, but no complaints so far. Nicely, had just received an offer for Amazon Prime the same day, so have been using the blue tooth to take advantage of that. If you need a player that won't skip during an earthquake, this seems to be the one.<br /><br /> I tried playing a CD recorded using Windows Media Player, a variety of song copied down from YouTube put to CD, and the CD worked fine. Was also able to insert a USB stick with Music copied to it from the computer and with the help of the Very Rapid Response Customer Service was enabled to work through a 'glitch' on my end in regard to how the player reads music stored on the USB device (which happens to be , 'a separate folder for each ripped CD' )","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dqi24DH8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dqi24DH8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dqi24DH8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NR2Uojy9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NR2Uojy9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NR2Uojy9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kfLc0jGjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kfLc0jGjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kfLc0jGjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07H6X3YQN,B07H6X3YQN,AHYDLAYCM6W7T5UUIBO63FV3SAFQ,1554428609309,True,12

I think this may have been mentioned by another reviewer but I had overlooked it earlier. Plugging into the unit eliminates the static also.  One last thing -- I would advise buyers of this product to purchase extra pads for the headphones. Once a style is no longer universally available the replacement pads can be very hard to find.

5.0,Excellent for One's Mental Health!,"If you are bothered as we are by unwanted callers, get this box. Once you mark a number as rejected, it will not repeat. We still have the box set in OFF mode, which means it continues to let calls through we have not marked as rejected. The reason is we have not heard from all of our accepted callers as yet. (Once you turn it on, if a call comes in that is not recognized by the box, it plays a message that tries to ward off the caller by asking them to enter zero if they think they are legit -- and call back, whereupon the caller will be admitted for answering. Note: we have NOT tried this feature. I expect it will work as described.)<br /><br />The box can handle up to 10,000 numbers, which is great. In a month we have received 92 calls and rejected 66. So you see it has helped us tremendously with unwanted callers.

4.0,A Satisfactory Replacement battery,"This battery is more than twice the capacity of the original, so it takes a while to charge (12-24 hrs.) I am glad I bought a 3-pack, as they are not that easy to find. I am not sure yet if the increased capacity makes the charge last 2x longer. The last charge held about a week, so I have no complaints. It beats replacing the entire phone.<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF USE<br />Even though the capacity of this battery is greater than the original, I find that a full charge does not last very long even with minimal use of the handset. I have the ringer OFF on the handset, too!

(My research suggested that this is the most common configuration for LCD projectors. It would work just as well on my wife's full-size laptop.)<br /><br />The cable fit perfectly on both pieces of hardware (Acer netbook, projector). My netbook has no holes to tighten the cable attachment, but I found I didn't need to make it any tighter.

5.0,Initial Reaction: Excellent! (See Updates Below),"Believe me when I tell you I read and read and read about these high-end RDs before making my choice. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was very uncertain. But after looking at reviews by people in the tech biz, I decided to take the plunge and so far I am very glad I did.<br /><br />After  very limited usage, this is what I have found (all I can do is speak for the unit I own):<br />1. the suction cups that came with the unit adhere to my windshield. The connection seems strong and tight. I left the cups on the windshield in 20-degree weather -- they have not budged. So far I see no need to buy a more deluxe suction device. I do remove the unit itself when I am out of the vehicle;<br /><br />2. the manual indicates that the RD is to be positioned flush against the windshield. So far I do not see a problem with that position. As I drive I have been keeping an eye on the unit. It remains steady, it shows no signs of movement on local streets (not the smoothest on God's earth, either);<br /><br />3. I was able to update the database of cameras by downloading the detector tools from the mfg. website. Since mine is a newer unit, I connected the unit via USB to a netbook, powered up the RD, clicked on the icons in the downloaded software, and was finished this process in about 15-20 mins. I did NOT have to do this download in my vehicle. The USB connection (netbook-to-RD) was all that was necessary; Note: until I turned the unit ON during the software update installation, the detector tools could not verify my serial number and the install would not proceed. (See my review of the AmazonBasics cable, which is the one you want for this RD.)<br /><br />4. so far the unit has functioned as described in the manual: it has very, very few false alarms, it stores detected points as I drive, I have it set on AUTO as recommended for the best hiway-city setting;<br /><br />5. compared to other detectors I have owned, which have all been in the $150 range, the Passport is by far the best at this early stage;<br /><br />I have yet to see how this baby behaves when I am on turnpikes and other places under surveillance by the good folks in blue. I am not a lead-foot particularly, I just love electronics; but there are times when the lull of the road will cause excessive speed. I like to be prepared.<br /><br />As I get more experience with this unit on the road, I will update this review. For now, I can honestly say this unit deserves the very high marks it has received on tech review websites. It looks and feels very well made.<br /><br />I am glad I made the move upward. I encourage you to do the same!<br /><br />First Update:<br />So far I have had no problems with the windshield suction cups adhering to the glass. The temperatures here have been between 20 and 50 degrees. From time to time I will press on the nubs to check the strength of the grip, and sometimes I will hear a ""clicking"" sound which ""resets"" the cups to full strength.<br /><br />I have been doing local driving only and there is very little ""chatter"" from the unit. I can only assume it is doing its job. It goes through the power up sequence just fine. I have not passed any stationary police vehicles. Another update will follow when I have somethinbg significant to report.<br /><br />Second Update: (April 21)<br />I finally had a chance to drive on the open road on a 4-hour round-trip. I can only assume that this detector is doing its job. True, I did not eyeball ANY police vehicles on my trip. The detector did not report any, either. So, is it working? As I say, I can only assume so. It did fire off several K-band alerts along the route, but nothing more.<br /><br />In my home area there are many speed cameras installed. My detector would have me believe than none are operative, since I have yet to receive a single camera alert. BTW, I am current on all updates via USB. I have nothing else to report, other than the fact that the unit powers up and self-tests as it should.<br /><br />Third Update May 14, 2013<br />For the first time since purchasing this detector it identified red light camera locations. I am now satisfied that this function is working properly.<br /><br />Fourth Update July 14, 2013<br />Even in extremely hot vehicle interior temperatures, the windshield suction cups have remained in place. As a matter of fact, the clip has not moved since I first attached it back in February.",[],B0063A0NZI,B07JVSC152,AF7J5A2ME55LSCRVQWXB3BKE7CHQ,1361478996000,True,6
5.0,"Excellent Cable Quality, Fits the Escort 9500ix RD","If you are looking for a USB cable to install updates on the Escort 9500ix, this is the one. I know I found only one site that mentioned the need for this cable type for the RD, so I am mentioning that fact here. Even after ordering it, I was not sure if it would be a perfect fit. It is.<br /><br />A couple of sites mentioned that the type of cable used with a digital camera would work with the 9500ix. Well the one I have would not have done the job, and I am very glad I did not try to force the matter. The mini-B end of the Amazon cable is a perfect fit for the Escort Passport 9500ix.<br /><br />Beyond that, Amazon can be proud of itself for putting its name on what I believe is an excellent cable: sturdy, well made. Certainly worth more than what Amazon asks for it. If all of Amazon's USB cables are as good as this one, you need never look elsewhere whenever you need such an item!",[],B001TH7GUK,B001TH7GUK,AF7J5A2ME55LSCRVQWXB3BKE7CHQ,1361456112000,True,0
5.0,A STUNNING Li'l RADIO! Hearing Aid Users Take Note!,"I don't usually purchase products that require earbuds because I have considerable hearing loss. However, I took a chance on this little radio and I am VERY glad I did. I can hear this radio extremely well -- it has a tremendous amount of volume power considering its size (4"" long, about the size of a cell phone). It has AM & FM bands, stereo/mono setting, can be used w/out the earbuds as a regular radio. It also allows memory pre-sets of your favorite stations. The radio attaches to your belt via a removable plastic clip.<br /><br />If you use hearing aids,you will need to remove them to use the earbuds, of course. I suppose you could try a different headset device -- one that can be used WITH hearing aids. I have found that I can hear this radio very well with the use of the earbuds. Again, my hearing loss is severe-to-profound, but I can hear this baby!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this radio for use with or without any type of headest. It takes two AAA batteries, which seem to last in this device a very long time!<br /><br />A top-notch product! GO FOR IT!",[],B000066R6M,B000066R6M,AF7J5A2ME55LSCRVQWXB3BKE7CHQ,1346672629000,True,0
4.0,Nice and Simple!,"OK, here are the facts: my other (similar) camera developed a glitch -- it will not allow me to delete photos without loooooong delays. So I went in search of an inexpensive replacement camera. I settled on this Canon.<br /><br />I did so with trepidation because some of the reviews were lukewarm at best. Yet other reviewers loved it. (This, by the way, is what makes horse races!) So I thought I would take a chance.<br /><br />Here is why I am happy with my choice: (1) the viewer seems larger than its dimensions suggest; (2) the camera fits in my shirt pocket; (3) the pics are crisp indoors and out; (4) the on-off button is clearly marked and the shot button is nice and robust. For me, these features are all I need. To be sure, the camera has a few video bells and whistles -- I'll try those one of these days. No rush.<br /><br />A Con: the shot button takes a little getting used to, since it appears to have two stages to it. If you just press and disengage, nothing will happen. It requires a little patience and then it will take the picture. I can live with that idiosyncrasy.<br /><br />Another Con: no internal memory. You must purchase an SD card before you can use the camera. This too I have accepted, because having pics on cards does make it easy to load them into PCs and laptops.<br /><br />If you are looking for a simple ""point-and-shoot"" camera that will also perform other tricks if you are of a mind, go for it!",[],B004HW73S4,B004YZZPZW,AF7J5A2ME55LSCRVQWXB3BKE7CHQ,1322236594000,True,11
4.0,A Great and Necessary Cover,"Since I wanted to protect my investment in a Kindle Touch, I ordered this cover. I am glad I did. It fits my Kindle Touch perfectly. The four corner straps secure it to the cover, and there is an elastic strap at the lower end that fits around the entire case, making the Kindle impervious to attack by foreign objects in your bag, backpack, what-have-you.<br /><br />I agree with others who have said the cover is a bit pricey, but if you love your Kindle Touch as much as I love mine, you will want to protect it for many years to come with this sturdy jacket.<br /><br />When I purchased the cover, I wondered if the flip design would get in my way. Not to worry. I find myself so focused on what I am reading that I don't even think about it being there.<br /><br />Do not expect to stand the cover up with the Kindle in it. Despite the rubber strips on each end, the cover will slide. Not good.<br /><br />All things said, I recommend this cover. The first (and I hope last) time your Kindle slips out of your hand, you will be glad you have a modicum of protection if the cover is open, and a lot of protection when it is closed and secured.",[],B005KDY8AU,B005KDY8AU,AF7J5A2ME55LSCRVQWXB3BKE7CHQ,1322221404000,True,31
5.0,Kindle Touch: A Solid A+,"I received my Kindle Touch on November 23. I could not wait to fire it up, and I can say without fear of contradiction (smile) that this is one superb product. Even before I received mine, I had ordered another for my wife for Christmas -- I just had a feeling it would be a good idea. And now that I have actually experienced it, I am so glad I purchased two.<br /><br />What is there not to love about this wonderful device? The screen is clear, the text is easy to read, you can change the size of the font if you have ""old eyes"" like mine, I can and have downloaded e-books from my local library and by way of Amazon Prime (if you are not a member of Amazon Prime, get to it -- it is well worth the investment). The downloads were amazingly quick (using my wireless home network). I have to say the books appeared on my Kindle instantaneously.<br /><br />As soon as I received my Kindle, I charged the battery using a USB port. A full charge from out of the box took 90 minutes.<br /><br />I am so impressed with this product. Speaking as a college professor, I never thought I would want to own an e-reader. I have always loved the feel of books in my hands. However, there are so many stunning features to the Kindle Touch that I can recommend to anyone who may have such a reservation.<br /><br />My hat is off to Amazon.Com for making this item available.

Bass is amazing and brain scrambling.  Mid range is clear and precise and not at all obscured by the lower and upper registers.  Highs are crisp and clear.<br />When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable.  They are very good at blocking outside sounds.  The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.  A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles.  Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released.  At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers.  I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.  I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.  These phones at less than  a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago.  I've seen headphones listing for a hell of a lot more, and I can't imagine that they can sound that much better than these Sony's to justify spending several times more for them.

5.0,"These pick up where the AirPods Pro fall off (or out, lol)","You NEED these if you have AirPods Pro. The earbuds are great but there is a crucial flaw, they fall out of my ears easily despite tip size. If my jaw moves (talking, smiling, chewing) the earbud works loose. I got tired of catching them or feeling embarrassed when one or both would fall out of my ears and go rolling around on the floor. Once it happened in a restaurant. Thank goodness for the quick reactions of our waiter! He saved me $200. While I am relieved, this is seriously not a laughable situation.<br /><br />Thank goodness a product like this. Since I have purchased them (8.99 for FOUR pairs) I have NOT lost my earbuds once! These are comfortable and easily taken off and put back on since the case will not close with them on. If you just need a quick charge you can leave them on and they will charge with the lid open. I highly recommend these. Do not waste your money on flimsy over the ear 'hooks' when these are the best thing going out there.",[],B089B4CFSC,B089B4CFSC,AHQV36LR2CZ2JIXQ472WAC3TCHKQ,1649201051289,True,1
4.0,These are my favorite ear buds but they have issues with staying in your ear,"I love the sound quality. The bass comes across very clear as if you’re in a room listening to a high-quality stereo.<br />The noise cancellation is the best that I’ve experienced. You have the option of either blocking everything out or allowing some noise to come in so that you can be aware in your environment. To give you an idea of how good the noise cancellation is, I have driven with my window down and have been sitting by a couple of Harleys at a stop light, neither instance was too loud for this setting. However, when the Harleys accelerated, I definitely heard them but they were not overwhelmingly loud.<br /><br />Like I mentioned in the title however, the only issue I have with them is they fall out easily no matter what size ear tip I use. So this caused another purchase for me to buy ear hooks to secure them in my ear. I would not buy the over the ear ear hooks however if you’re looking for some get the ones that secure them inside your ear.

4.0,It's a nice keyboard complete with cover and back-lit LEDs,"This keyboard is nice. I had previously been using a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse by Jellycomb, which were fantastic for being quiet, but they have issues after about 3 months of use.<br /><br />I figured a wired keyboard would be less likely to have the same ghosting issues and I wanted another quiet keyboard. This one is slim profile, has cool blacklighting, and is very quiet when the cover is on.<br /><br />However, while I like the cover, it is rather thick, making typing a bit difficult. It's hard to explain, but it's like the edges can get caught on the cover. Still a nice keyboard but it could problems if you're gaming or trying to type fast a lot. Alternatively, you can take off the cover and it's not too bad. But I keep it on to keep it quiet.<br /><br />Pros<br />- quiet<br />- cool leds<br />- slim profile<br />- has cover and it's durable<br />- cool styling of the keys<br /><br />Cons<br />- hard to type (with cover)<br />- a little louder without the cover",[],B08CZFQCKL,B0C65PM6LG,AEC6MVPIPSLIVH7MQMW3U5XFND5A,1604926353794,True,7
4.0,HALF the charge of a standard gopro battery,"I picked this up since it came with extra batteries and a charging station for pretty cheap ($16). I simply wanted back ups if my regular gopro batteries died and also to be able to charge multiple batteries at once.<br /><br />So far I've noticed that the battery packs last only half the charge of the official gopro batteries. I've also noticed that the charging station sometimes doesn't charge the gopro batteries entirely. The display may also erroneously display a battery as fully charged when it isn't.<br /><br />Because of this, I haven't really trusted this dock to charge up the official batteries and instead only using the ones it comes with.<br /><br />Despite the cons, it's a good price for what you get and I ended up ordering a second set.<br /><br />Note that I am using these with a GoPro hero 7 black.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- charge multiple batteries<br />- charges gopro brand batteries too<br />- great value for price<br /><br />Cons<br />- sometimes doesn't charge batteries correctly<br />- doesn't charge gopro brand batteries entirely<br />- half the battery charge of gopro brand batteries",[],B077C6VSS1,B077C6VSS1,AEC6MVPIPSLIVH7MQMW3U5XFND5A,1578386315623,True,0

It's a can of air. I used it to clean my computer and keyboard and it does that just fine. Came at a pretty good deal compared to other brands but functioned just as well.<br /><br />The bonus stand is a random accessory to pair with this product. However, as far as stands go, it's pretty decent. It has very good grip and works well with any phone, and is sturdy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not much really. Its compressed air and works as intended. Only downside is that it seems to leave a bit more cold condensation when you use it compared to other products. I haven't had it hurt anything but if that's a problem, perhaps look for a more trusted product.<br /><br />The stand works like a stand.

2.0,An interesting item but finicky,"Review update:<br />After using the keyboard for a little while, some of the keys stopped functioning and rolling up or bending the keyboard for storage or moving it, permanently damaged the product. There's no point to a flexible keyboard if it breaks because you bent it slightly. Not a very useful product beyond the novelty. Wouldn't recommend it unless you've been dying to have a quirky unresponsive keyboard you can take with you.<br /><br />------------<br />When I set to order a flexible keyboard, I mainly wanted it for the novelty. That is probably for the best since this keyboard is very unique. It lights up, is bendable and has nice texture to it. However, the keys are a little unresponsive unless you press them from a certain angle. Also the keyboard is a little larger than normal keyboards because of the extra inch and a half of covered wires at the end.<br />  If you are looking for a keyboard which is for gaming or for typing very fast, this is not the keyboard for you. If you want something cool and easy to pack or move, then you will likely love it.",[],B001E25JMM,B001E25JMM,AEC6MVPIPSLIVH7MQMW3U5XFND5A,1319478885000,True,0

5.0,Seems Very Durable,"The external cover (sage green) is more dense and less rubbery than expected, but it does seem to be plenty durable. It’s only just flexible enough to get it off/on but otherwise it does not budge, and I think that’s a good thing so long as it protects my pad when I drop it - and I will drop it at some point. Bright side, the handle is so much easier to hang onto maybe I won’t drop it! The handle/stand is very rigid and stays in place wherever I put it. I appreciate the little tab on the back that can hold a generic stylus pencil plus the Apple Pencil cutout making this a versatile case. This wasn’t my first pick primarily because of the color options, but I’m very happy with the product so I’ll get used to it. It doesn’t have a screen cover, but the screen-surround protects a good 4-5 mm over the screen so it should be fine if it lands face-down.

2.0,"Poor player, don't waste the money on this model","This blu-ray player (Sharp Aquos BD-HP22U) is extremely slow to respond to anything. Do not make the mistake of turning it off with a disc in it. It takes a good 3-5 minutes to turn on unless you leave it on standby (solid red light). If you leave a disc in the player, turning it on will stretch into 5 minutes or more while it also needs to load a disc inside. When it first recognizes power (as in unplugging it to save a little $), the power light continually blinks red for several minutes apparently thinking about the access of electricity, before you can push power to turn it on. If you attempt to insist it turn on or open the tray, it just makes the process take even longer. Once power has been accessed and you first put in a new disc, it loads in a reasonable period of time, but slowly. We had it for two weeks before it asked for a software/firmware update and refused to play blu-ray discs, but this particular model HP22U actually does NOT even exist according to Sharp's website and so far, no update has been possible. After several months of continuing to use it just for DVD, it has begun to skip on DVDs, even brand new ones, and will not play others.

4.0,4 Stars because of the size!! Easy set up.,"This tablet is a great concept for having small tablets. I really enjoy the peace of mind that if the grandkids want to watch a movie on this, it has safe search settings for them to use. And if they are eating or drinking, more then likely they will be spilling something or leaving wonderfully adorable fingerprints all over this. So with it being water ‘resistent’, I am not to concerned about cleaning it afterwards. The battery life appears to be holding up quiet well. I have not used an android device very much but the “Ok Google” to start the voice activation is REALLY awesome!! Makes searching for recipes, music, videos, books or anything else online really convenient!!<br /><br />Once you sign into a google account, the device pretty much sets itself up without much hassle of having to create multiple new logins for different companies.<br /><br />The expandable memory slot is a really nice addition for adding a micro-SD, ive noticed they have dropped the prices on those so its very simple to make room or add media from a main computer.<br /><br />Cons: (so far)<br />A downside to this, because of the size, the screen resolution is a bit odd. And when looking at high resolution images, they still appear somewhat grainy.<br /><br />I think overall, for the price of this tablet, its an incredible deal, especially if you have kids that are starting to get on the internet, the kids safe option is a serious peace of mind at least for my family!",[],B01GE9R0J4,B01GE9R0J4,AHJQPUQLSQZE6LMIUMY7WNRXCQQQ,1475785820000,False,4
5.0,"Two thumbs up. Bright, and works when electricity goes out.","I have never bought anything, or knew about “Mr. Beams” before, and I wish I knew about these lights before.<br />There easy to install, and they do Work great.<br /><br />I have 3 boxes of Security Spotlights sitting (from Lowes) in my garage for over 6 months that have to be electrically installed!<br />Which means I have to call a electrician, as my husband is Not handy. I’m sure it will cost me over<br />$100.00 to install those.<br /><br /> But Mr. Beams is easy to install. Even my husband can do this.<br />It takes 4 D batteries for each light.<br />The plastic is strong. In a little plastic bag are the screws with plastic things to insert the screws into..<br /><br />The back plastic plate slips off , then there is 4 large plastic type screws.<br />Unscrew, put in your batteries, “flat side down on the springs, very easy” put your screws back in..A 5 yr old can do this.<br /> But my husband then had to get up on a ladder, mark off where you want this to go, drill little holes to screw in the back plate.<br />Now that the plate is screwed to the house , or where you want it, slip on Mr. Beams lights, move the side lights at<br />to what angle you want the light to shine on, get off the ladder,<br />You are Done, and No Electrician. No more $$$$$$.<br /><br />These lights are allot brighter then we thought.<br />Great for when the kids get out of there car to walk to the door, Brighter then the two lights I have on both sides of the garage doors.<br />The light stays on for about 30 seconds, but if you are still in the Beam, it will stay on longer, which is a plus for us, when you are<br />carry babies, its raining, its snowing (hopefully) or using the code to get into the garage  to come into the house.<br /><br />Also if the power goes off, you will still have light, what a plus for us.Yay.<br /><br />I live on a few acres in the mountains, Ca. Gets VERY dark here at night although we do have some outdoor lights.<br />We had a power outage for 9 days here a few years ago, which is along time.<br />We used a generator for the frig & freezer, bathrooms etc.(gas cost about 200.00 or more using the generator) but outside it was pitch dark.<br /> I wish we would have known about Mr. Beams before, it would have made our life allot easier, needless to say.<br /><br />Btw, buy good batteries they last longer, and to replace them in this is very easy.<br />We keep a supply of different batteries.<br />We will be buying more battery run outdoor lights from Mr. Beams.<br /><br />It said these are also water proof.<br /> This is a 5 star. If these do not last long,or not water proof, I will be back to up date this review.",[],B01IIVZ2Q4,B0B1S5LBRQ,AHJQPUQLSQZE6LMIUMY7WNRXCQQQ,1472246459000,False,1
5.0,Powerful machine for a great price!,"This is a great little computer! For anyone looking at computers for gaming reasons but they do not have a large budget this is a great solution!<br /> I was having low expectations due to the size of this but the graphics card keeps up great! Setup took no time at all, the compact design is great for having a low profile computer on my desk and hardly noticing it.<br /><br />The 4 USBs' are slightly a let down but I already have a USB 3.0 hub so its really not a problem with that. I think its a $20 fix if someone has a lot of USB accessories.<br /><br />The HDMI pass through option is awesome! Super convenient to still use my other computer for duel monitors for work.<br /><br />I would highly suggest this if someone is on the fence about deciding what to get. Make sure to check the specs for the games you want to play but this should keep up well for the price of it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Perfect computer for gaming<br />-Compact design<br />-good specs<br />-easy setup<br />-comes with mouse & keyboard<br />- HDMI passthrough<br /><br />Cons:<br />- 4 USB slots",[],B01F3R9DP2,B01F3R9DP2,AHJQPUQLSQZE6LMIUMY7WNRXCQQQ,1471041361000,False,2
3.0,"Great concept, good company, BUT its just not there yet","This is a great idea that has been done by many companies. I would have hoped that motorola would have been able to nail down the design and build of these earbuds to work well. Maybe this is the first batch that came out and its just being buggy with the firmware but there are some things that are frustrating with this headset especially when they have some out for less then $100.<br /><br />As others have stated, when you have the earbuds in, they both are required to be in or the music stops playing. At first this seems like a good idea but when you want to listen to whats going on around you, you'll also be pausing music.<br /><br />They feel a little awkward in the ear, doesn't feel very secure if running around, but in the gym they seemed to work well enough unless jumping around.<br /><br />I understand why the earbuds need to be connected to the dock to change settings but they are bluetooth. It should be a simple enough solution to change all the settings in the app or device being used without having to put them in the dock every time.<br /><br />Battery life has not been great with the advertised 12 hours. Usually getting a few hours out of them and thats with using them when i first got them letting them die all the way and then charging them up.<br /><br />I along with a handful of others appear to be having issues with the right earbud dropping out randomly... kinda odd, might be a firmware thing but unknown.<br /><br />For the money, I would wait till Motorola is able to make a second pass over this product. Update the firmware and figure out if the glitches are hardware based or in the firmware.",[],B01F5FYXM0,B01H7HQ71E,AHJQPUQLSQZE6LMIUMY7WNRXCQQQ,1468057504000,False,0

Theres a couple of things to think of if your a major music enthusiast.uld be<br /><br />Pros:<br />This is a great headset for traveling. The design is cool and the case is convenient for keeping the cables with the headset. The batteries last a long time with using both the regular power and the bass boost, the daisy chain for an additional headset is a great idea and works well with sitting next to someone or sharing a song with someone and with the ability to charge a device through the USB has been awesome! They are loud when they are turned on, to much for me if they are turned up all the way.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The sound quality is a tad disappointing. I would imagine if I played with the equalizer on the phone around but for just plugging them in they are flat. The regular sound is ok when the headset is powered but the bass boost could be a lot better for adding bass.<br /><br />If these were bluetooth that wo absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Hope this helps with anyone looking for a new headset!",[],B011A49BYA,B011A49BYA,AHJQPUQLSQZE6LMIUMY7WNRXCQQQ,1460484658000,False,1
4.0,Shorter then my apple mouse and thicker.,"Up-Date. I now have been using this Dell wireless mouse for a few weeks.<br />Since its shorter and a big hump in the middle with the index finger roller, I have been having all of pain in my right Wrist, and my Wrist bone has been getting swollen.<br />I can only attribute this problem to the Dell mouse!<br />I'm not sure it is caused from this mouse yet, but this has never happened to me before..!!!<br />I'll will be going back to my Apple mouse,and  if the pain does go away, I will know for sure, its this mouse that caused the pain!<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />When I installed the Dell Mouse to my computer.  the arrow was moving VERY fast all over the screen.I had to go into tools to slow it way down.<br />I'm a women with small hands long fingers and it seems to work for me.<br />Although this seems to be about 1 inch shorter then my apple mouse, and thicker. It will take a little getting use to!<br />I also have to get use to the the small roller to scroll the page.<br /><br />The reason I got the Dell mouse was, it said I will not have to change the battery as often , which is a pain in neck for me<br />This holds one double A batterie. To open , you have to pinch the sides buttons together, but the two tops still do not come off that easy.

3.0,Pros & Cons.*Need*to have a good router to handle any streaming options for this system to work.,"This review is assuming you know what Steam is, and have an account + avid gamer. If you do not know what those are, this is not the system for you. The price point on this is steep if you don't already have games for this system. With that being said, it is a a neat concept. The controllers are awesome! It will take a little while to figure them out, have fun typing with the touch pads, it took me a few minutes to get it down. Great to be able to play some of the games on this, however due to the OS on this not all of the games are available for this, which then requires the Steam streaming setup. From my experiences with this, the streaming does not work well without a good router. From a PC with ethernet to this with ethernet from the same router it was not playable. But if thats the case then Ill play on the desktop for the intense games.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Its Steam. If you have an account and have been playing their games since forever, you have the games.<br />High learning curve for this controller for anyone thats been using an xbox or playstation controller, however the functionality is really enjoyable.<br />The two touchpad for the controllers is very interesting. I was playing boarder lands and the right touch pad with as low as they go movement sensitivity is really a challenge to get that working correctly.<br />The controllers community presets are a good place to start when trying to get the buttons to be useful.<br /><br />Con:<br />I've had Amnesia and couple other games on medium settings lock up on me multiple times and thats without multitasking. With the game paused, I try the browser and the system occasionally locks up. So my next thought is to wipe the whole thing and start over with it...Not that big of a priority at the moment as<br /><br />*Need*to have a good router to handle any streaming options for this system to work.<br /><br />The TB hard drive is very nice for the space, however the load times would of course be much better with SSD inside.<br /><br />The processor is a 4th gen, which works well but with the current 6th gens out it seems that they can have that updated with the pricing. Possibly would help with this locking up?<br /><br />The Steam OS is nice being that it requires less to load, but functionality is a bit disappointing. Because of this operating system, the games can not be downloaded to the Machine.<br /><br />Terrible luck with trying to stream anything from the PC to this.<br /><br />For anyone looking to have a streaming solution for Steam, a Steam Link might be the way to go and put some more $ in your pc. Check out that info here: http://www.amazon.com/Steam-Link-Pc/dp/B016XBGWAQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1454617609&sr=8-1&keywords=steam+link",[],B015XK1O6K,B015XK1O6K,AHJQPUQLSQZE6LMIUMY7WNRXCQQQ,1454651626000,False,4

I do not think we are being too picky!!<br /> Maybe this is because its the first images printed.
